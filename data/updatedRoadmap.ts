UPDATED PRE-PRODUCTION ROADMAP: THE VANGUARD (REVISED SCRIPT)

CRITICAL UPDATES BASED ON SCRIPT REVISIONS
Based on the comprehensive script doctor analysis and the revised screenplay, I'm updating the technical pre-production roadmap to reflect the new narrative structure, enhanced visual storytelling, and refined character arcs.
