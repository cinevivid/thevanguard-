# THE VANGUARD: DIRECTOR'S VISUAL LOOKBOOK
## Cinematography, Color Palette & Aesthetic Vision

**Purpose:** Visual bible for consistent cinematic style across all 430 shots  
**Target Audience:** Director (you), cinematographers (AI prompts), colorists, VFX team  
**Core Philosophy:** Brutalist minimalism meets emotional devastation

---

## 🎨 VISUAL MISSION STATEMENT

**THE VANGUARD is visually cold, institutional, and claustrophobic—until it's not.**

We live in:
- Concrete walls
- Fluorescent lighting  
- Desaturated tones
- Static cameras
- Anamorphic 2.39:1

Until flashbacks to 2095, or Debra's hospital room, or Victor's memories—where color, warmth, and humanity briefly exist before being crushed by the brutalism of military power.

**Visual Thesis:** *Beauty is the memory of what we've lost. Coldness is what remains.*

---

## 📐 ASPECT RATIO & FRAMING

### **2.39:1 (Anamorphic) - Why This Ratio?**

**Emotional Reasoning:**
- Wide frame = Isolation (small people in big spaces)
- Horizontal compression = Trapped (can't escape frame)
- Cinematic heritage (Blade Runner 2049, Arrival, Prisoners)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Midjourney parameter: \`--ar 21:9\` (equivalent to 2.39:1)
- All 430 shots use this ratio (consistency)
- No exceptions (even close-ups stay wide)

**Compositional Rules:**
1. **Center framing** for power (Duncan, Vanguard)
2. **Off-center** for vulnerability (Jackson)
3. **Negative space** for isolation (empty frame around characters)
4. **Symmetry** for order and control (military environments)

---

## 📷 CINEMATOGRAPHY STYLE

### **PRIMARY INFLUENCE: Denis Villeneuve's Collaborations with Roger Deakins (Prisoners, Blade Runner 2049)**

**Key Characteristics:**
- Static, locked-off camera (no handheld)
- Slow, deliberate push-ins (emotional moments only)
- Wide establishing shots (show architecture)
- Extreme close-ups (reveal humanity)
- Naturalistic lighting (harsh, unflattering)

---

### **CAMERA MOVEMENT RULES:**

**STATIC SHOTS (95% of film):**
- Interrogation Room 111: 100% static (psychological pressure)
- Underground Base hallways: Static (institutional control)
- Office scenes: Static (authority, hierarchy)

**SLOW PUSH-INS (4% of film):**
- Victor's first words: Push into his visor
- Jackson's breakdown: Push into her face
- Duncan's realization: Push into his eyes
- Used ONLY for major emotional beats

**HANDHELD (1% of film):**
- Armor surgery scene: Chaotic, nauseating
- Duncan dying: Disorienting, collapsing reality
- Used ONLY for horror/disorientation

---

### **SHOT TYPES BY SCENE:**

**Interrogation Room 111:**
- 60% Medium shots (across table, both characters visible)
- 25% Close-ups (single character, emotional reaction)
- 10% Extreme close-ups (hands, visor, eyes)
- 5% Wide shots (establish room, isolation)

**Underground Base:**
- 50% Wide shots (show architecture, scale)
- 30% Medium shots (characters walking)
- 15% Close-ups (faces, reactions)
- 5% Inserts (details, tech, props)

**Flashbacks (2095):**
- 40% Medium shots (Victor in training)
- 30% Wide shots (dystopian future)
- 20% Close-ups (fear, pain, humanity)
- 10% Extreme close-ups (surgery horror)

---

## 📐 COMPOSITIONAL RULES

### **RULE OF THIRDS (Broken Intentionally)**

**Standard Films:** Place subjects on 1/3 lines  
**THE VANGUARD:** Center subjects (authority, symmetry)

**Why:**
- Center framing = power, control (Duncan, Vanguard)
- Off-center = vulnerability (Jackson, when alone)
- Symmetry = institutional order
- Asymmetry = chaos (armor surgery, Duncan's death)

---

### **HEADROOM & BREATHING SPACE**

**Close-ups:** Tight framing, minimal headroom (pressure)  
**Medium shots:** Standard headroom  
**Wide shots:** Excessive negative space (isolation)

**Example:**
- Jackson in interrogation room: Small in wide frame, alone
- Vanguard fills frame: Imposing, massive, dominant

---

### **DEPTH & LAYERS**

**Foreground | Middle | Background**

**Interrogation Room:**
- Foreground: Jackson's shoulder (out of focus)
- Middle: Vanguard's visor (sharp focus)
- Background: Concrete wall (soft)

**Underground Hallway:**
- Foreground: Character walking (sharp)
- Middle: Hallway extends (leading lines)
- Background: Vanishing point (infinity)

---

## 🎬 VFX VISUAL STYLE

### **60 VFX Shots - Consistent Style:**

**1. Visor Glow (15 shots):**
- Red light emanating from visor
- Soft bloom (not harsh)
- Intensifies with emotion
- Practical-looking (not CGI-obvious)

**2. Hologram Timeline (18 shots):**
- Blue transparent geometry
- Soft glow (not neon)
- Branches float (slowly)
- Interaction: Touch = glow brighter

**3. Bullet Time (25 shots):**
- 5% speed (hyper slow-motion)
- Sharp focus on bullet
- Motion blur on background
- Shockwave distortion (air)

**4. Armor Assembly (12 shots):**
- Tendrils pierce skin (clinical, surgical)
- Blood minimal (not splatter)
- Metal fuses to flesh (organic + mechanical)
- Victor's face: Pain, horror

---

**Prisoners (2013):**
- Detective interrogation scenes (cold fluorescent)
- Concrete basement (oppressive)
- Gray palette throughout

**Arrival (2016):**

- Alien pod interior (organic + mechanical)
- Montana landscape (isolation)

**EX MACHINA (2014):**

- Asylum scenes (institutional horror)
- Future dystopia (2035 underground)

## 🎬 FINAL VISUAL STATEMENT

**THE VANGUARD looks cold because it is cold.**

We're not making a "pretty" sci-fi film. We're making a film about:
- Institutional power crushing individuals
- Time travel as horror, not adventure
- Humanity losing to technology
- Beauty existing only in memory

**Every frame should feel:**
- **Oppressive** (architecture dominates)
- **Clinical** (humans are specimens)
- **Isolated** (negative space, wide frames)
- **Inevitable** (we can't escape what's coming)

**Except:**
- Debra's hospital room (warmth, love, humanity)
- Which makes the return to cold UNBEARABLE

**That contrast IS the film.**

Cold → Warm → Cold = Emotional devastation
