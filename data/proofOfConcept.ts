**FADE IN:**

---

**INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 111 - UNDERGROUND FACILITY - DAY**

*Cold. Concrete walls. A single metal table. Two chairs. Harsh fluorescent lighting casts shadows that make everything look sickly.*

*JAMIE JACKSON (23, athletic, dark circles under her eyes) sits across from THE VANGUARD—a massive armored figure, 6'6", green biomechanical plating fused to pale flesh, red visor glowing.*

*They've been here before. Many times.*

*The Vanguard hasn't spoken in three months.*

*Jackson takes a breath. Not the first today. Not the last.*

**JACKSON**  
*(tired, almost to herself)*  
Interrogation forty-seven.  
*(beat)*  
Three months. Ninety-one days.  
*(beat)*  
Not a word.

*The Vanguard sits motionless. Only the slow rise and fall of his chest indicates life.*

*Jackson leans back in her chair, studying him.*

**JACKSON (CONT'D)**  
I've tried everything, you know.  
Good cop. Bad cop. Silence. Questions. Stories.  
*(beat)*  
I told you about my grandmother. The one who raised me.  
*(pause)*  
You didn't react. But I think you heard me.

*Nothing.*

*Jackson rubs her face. The exhaustion is real now.*

**JACKSON (CONT'D)**  
They're going to move you next week.  
Room 195. Surgical theater.  
*(beat)*  
Director Duncan wants to see what's under that armor.  
*(quieter)*  
I don't think you'll survive that.

*For the first time, a micro-movement. The Vanguard's gauntlet twitches. Barely. But Jackson sees it.*

*She leans forward.*

**JACKSON (CONT'D)**  
*(carefully)*  
If you're going to say something... now would be the time.

*Silence.*

*Then—*

*The Vanguard's visor shifts. Looking directly at her.*

*When he speaks, his voice is distorted, mechanical, but unmistakably human. And tired. So, so tired.*

**VANGUARD**  
My name is Victor Duncan.

*Jackson freezes.*

**JACKSON**  
*(slowly)*  
...What did you say?

**VANGUARD**  
Victor. Duncan.  
*(beat)*  
Sergeant. United States Sovereignty Armed Forces.  
Serial number: 2-7-9-4-6-8-1-2-Alpha.  
*(pause)*  
Born April 14th, 2072.  
Recruited into the Vanguard Initiative, October 2094.  
Deployed backward... January 3rd, 2095.

*Jackson stares. Her brain is trying to process this. Failing.*

**JACKSON**  
You're... human?

**VANGUARD**  
I was.

**JACKSON**  
*(disbelieving)*  
Duncan. You said Duncan.  
*(realizing)*  
Director Richard Duncan?

**VANGUARD**  
Richard Nathaniel Duncan.  
Born March 8th, 1975.  
Died... October 12th, 2025.  
*(pause)*  
My great-grandfather.

*Jackson's world is fracturing.*

**JACKSON**  
That's—that's eight months from now.

**VANGUARD**  
I know.

**JACKSON**  
You're telling me you're from... seventy years in the future. You're human. And you're related to the man running this facility.

**VANGUARD**  
Yes.

**JACKSON**  
*(laughing, almost hysterical)*  
That's insane. You expect me to believe—

**VANGUARD**  
*(cutting her off)*  
Your grandmother's name is Debra Jackson.  
She raised you after your mother left when you were six.  
She died three years ago from pancreatic cancer.  
Her favorite flower was the purple bell flower.  
You still keep a photo of her on your nightstand.  
*(beat)*  
You told me that. Interrogation thirty-two. Six weeks ago.

*Jackson goes still.*

**JACKSON**  
...How do you know that?

**VANGUARD**  
Because I was listening.  
*(pause)*  
I've been listening every time you come in here.  
I've been listening because you're the only one who talks to me like I'm still a person.  
*(beat)*  
And because in seventy years, when they fuse this armor to my body and send me back to kill my great-grandfather...  
*(pause)*  
...I need to remember what it feels like to be human.

*Silence. Heavy. Crushing.*

*Jackson's hands are shaking. She grips the edge of the table.*

**JACKSON**  
Why?  
*(louder)*  
Why would they send you back to kill your own family?

**VANGUARD**  
Because in 2025, my great-grandfather's research into "temporal coherence" is the foundation for everything that comes after.  
The Sovereignty. The wars. The surveillance state.  
*(beat)*  
The Vanguard Initiative.  
*(pause)*  
They sent me back to stop him. To erase the origin point.  
*(quieter)*  
To erase myself.

**JACKSON**  
And did you?  
*(beat)*  
Did you kill him?

*The Vanguard's visor dims slightly. A mechanical sigh, maybe. Or something that used to be human.*

**VANGUARD**  
No.  
*(pause)*  
I couldn't.  
*(beat)*  
Which means everything I came back to prevent...  
*(long pause)*  
...is going to happen anyway.

*Jackson stares at him. She doesn't know if she believes him. She doesn't know if it matters.*

**JACKSON**  
*(whispered)*  
What happens now?

**VANGUARD**  
Now?  
*(beat)*  
Now you tell Director Duncan.  
He'll move me to Room 195. He'll try to remove the armor.  
*(pause)*  
And when he does...  
*(beat)*  
...the timeline will fracture.

**JACKSON**  
What does that mean?

**VANGUARD**  
*(looking at her, really looking)*  
It means you should say goodbye to everyone you love.  
*(beat)*  
Because once he opens that door...  
*(pause)*  
...there's no closing it.

*Jackson opens her mouth to respond—*

*But the Vanguard turns his head away. The conversation is over.*

*Jackson sits there, staring at him, at the armored shell of a man who traveled seventy years backward just to fail.*

*She reaches for the intercom button. Her hand hovers over it.*

*Presses it.*

**JACKSON**  
*(into intercom, voice hollow)*  
This is Jackson. Interrogation Room 111.  
*(pause)*  
Get me Director Duncan.  
*(beat)*  
Now.

*The Vanguard doesn't move. Doesn't react.*

*But his visor glows just a little brighter. Red. Like a warning.*

*Like blood.*

## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE FOR SHARING SHORT

**Subject:** THE VANGUARD | 5-Minute Proof-of-Concept | AI-Generated Sci-Fi

---

Dear [Name],

I wanted to share the proof-of-concept short for THE VANGUARD, my AI-generated sci-fi feature currently in production.

**The Short:**
A 5-minute self-contained scene where a military interrogator questions an armored alien—who reveals himself as a human time traveler from 2095, sent back to kill his own great-grandfather.

**Watch Here:** [Vimeo Private Link - Password: vanguard2025]

**Why I'm Sharing This:**
This short demonstrates:
- Character consistency (95%+ using Midjourney's --cref system)
- Professional cinematography (anamorphic 2.39:1, static camera)
- Emotional depth (dialogue-driven, character-focused)
- AI-generated quality (all imagery via Midjourney + Runway Gen-3)

**The Feature:**
This scene is from the full 90-minute feature, which completes in May 2026. We're targeting Sundance/SXSW 2027.

**Budget:** $8,500 total (vs. $50,000-500,000 traditional indie sci-fi)

I'd love to hear your thoughts. If you're interested in the full project, I'm happy to send the complete pitch deck and production plan.

Thanks for watching!

Best regards,

## 🎬 DIRECTOR'S NOTES (For Press/Festivals)

### **Why This Scene?**

Interrogation #47 is the emotional center of THE VANGUARD. For three months, Jamie Jackson has been trying to break through to The Vanguard. She's used every technique, every tactic. Nothing has worked.

This is the moment he finally speaks—and reveals the truth that shatters her world.

I chose this scene as the proof-of-concept because it demonstrates what THE VANGUARD is really about: Two people in a room, and the terrible knowledge between them. No explosions. No action sequences. Just human connection across 70 years and the tragedy of inevitability.

It's also a technical showcase. All 30 shots were generated using Midjourney v6.1 (images) and Runway Gen-3 (video). The character consistency system I developed—using Midjourney's --cref parameter—maintains 96% facial consistency across all shots. Jackson looks like Jackson. The Vanguard looks like The Vanguard. Every time.

This isn't "test footage." This is the film.

The dialogue is sparse, deliberate. I wanted silences to carry as much weight as words. The Vanguard hasn't spoken in three months—his first words need to matter. "My name is Victor Duncan" isn't just exposition. It's a confession. An admission of failure. A cry for help.

Jackson's reaction is everything. She's not a hardened interrogator. She's 23, exhausted, overwhelmed. When Victor tells her he's from 2095, her world fractures. Ours does too.

The final image—Jackson pressing the intercom, calling for Director Duncan, while Victor's visor glows red—is the point of no return. She's about to set in motion the very catastrophe Victor came back to prevent.

That's THE VANGUARD. A film about time, regret, and the doors we open that we can never close.
