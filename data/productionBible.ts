PART 1: MASTER PRODUCTION FRAMEWORK

1.1 EXECUTIVE PRODUCTION PHILOSOPHY

The AI Filmmaking Paradigm
This production treats AI as a computational filmmaking partner, not a replacement for human creativity. You are the director, cinematographer, production designer, and VFX supervisor rolled into one—but instead of managing a crew of 50, you're managing a suite of AI tools.

Core Principle: Build systems that enforce consistency, not perfection.

AI tools will fail. They will generate inconsistent characters, break physics, hallucinate objects, and drift in style. Your job is not to prevent all failures—it's to build a production architecture that:
1.  Detects failures quickly
2.  Regenerates efficiently
3.  Maintains visual coherence across 400+ shots
4.  Delivers a professional final product

The Three Pillars of AI Production

PILLAR 1: CANONICAL REFERENCE ASSETS
*   Lock hero character models before generating any scenes
*   Create location master plans with multi-angle references
*   Establish color palettes and lighting specifications
*   Build a "visual DNA" for your film

PILLAR 2: SYSTEMATIC PROMPT ENGINEERING
*   Every shot gets a structured, multi-parameter prompt
*   Reference canonical assets in every prompt
*   Use consistent terminology across all generations
*   Document every prompt and its results

PILLAR 3: ITERATIVE QUALITY ASSURANCE
*   Review every generated asset against reference standards
*   Maintain a consistency dashboard tracking all shots
*   Regenerate problem shots immediately
*   Build in 20% regeneration buffer in timeline

1.2 AI WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

The Production Pipeline (6 Phases)

PHASE 1: PRE-PRODUCTION (Weeks 1-4)
- Script breakdown -> Scene bible
- Character design -> Canonical references
- Location design -> Master plans
- Visual language -> Color palettes & lighting guides
- Prompt templates -> Structured generation system

PHASE 2: STORYBOARD GENERATION (Weeks 5-10)
- Shot-by-shot image generation (400-600 images)
- Consistency checks per scene
- Dialogue overlay integration
- Pre-viz reel assembly
- QA checkpoints every 50 shots

PHASE 3: VIDEO GENERATION (Weeks 11-18)
- Image-to-video conversion (all shots)
- Motion testing and refinement
- Character consistency validation
- Scene assembly and rough cuts
- Problem shot regeneration (15-20% expected)

PHASE 4: AUDIO PRODUCTION (Weeks 12-18, parallel)
- Dialogue generation (AI voice or actors)
- SFX library creation
- Music composition
- Ambient sound design

PHASE 5: POST-PRODUCTION (Weeks 19-24)
- Video editing and timing
- Color grading pass
- Audio mix and synchronization
- VFX refinement and compositing
- Final QA and notes

PHASE 6: MASTERING & DELIVERY (Week 24)
- Final render (multiple formats)
- Quality verification
- Distribution prep
- Festival submission materials

Tool Stack Recommendations

IMAGE GENERATION:
*   Primary: Midjourney v6 (character consistency via --cref)
*   Secondary: Stable Diffusion XL + ControlNet (spatial control)
*   Backup: DALL-E 3 (if MJ/SD fail)

VIDEO GENERATION:
*   Primary: Runway Gen-3 or Gen-4 (best motion quality)
*   Secondary: Pika Labs (good for simpler shots)
*   Backup: Stable Video Diffusion (free, lower quality)

AUDIO GENERATION:
*   Voice: ElevenLabs (character voice cloning)
*   SFX: Eleven Labs Sound Effects / Soundly AI
*   Music: Suno AI / Udio (score generation)

POST-PRODUCTION:
*   Editing: DaVinci Resolve Studio (free version sufficient)
*   VFX: After Effects + AI plugins (Topaz Video AI for upscaling)
*   Audio Mix: DaVinci Fairlight or Audition

1.3 QUALITY CONTROL PROTOCOLS

The Three-Tier QA System

TIER 1: SHOT-LEVEL QA (Every Shot) Checklist per shot:
- Character matches canonical reference (95%+ similarity)
- Location spatial layout is correct
- Color palette matches act specification
- No AI hallucinations (extra objects, wrong anatomy)
- Lighting direction is consistent
- Technical quality acceptable (resolution, clarity)

TIER 2: SCENE-LEVEL QA (Every Scene) Checklist per scene:
- All shots maintain visual continuity
- Character positions/blocking make sense
- Emotional arc builds correctly
- Dialogue timing matches shot duration
- No jarring style shifts between shots

TIER 3: ACT-LEVEL QA (Every 30 pages) Checklist per act:
- Visual style remains consistent
- Character appearance hasn't drifted significantly
- Color grading feels cohesive
- Pacing and rhythm work
- No major continuity breaks

Regeneration Thresholds

MINOR ISSUES (Regenerate Individual Shots):
*   Character details slightly off (5-10% variance)
*   Lighting slightly inconsistent
*   Minor prop placement errors
*   Small timing mismatches

MODERATE ISSUES (Regenerate Full Scene):
*   Character significantly different (>10% variance)
*   Location layout doesn't match reference
*   Color palette drift noticeable
*   Multiple shots in same scene fail QA

SEVERE ISSUES (Redesign Approach):
*   Entire scene visually incoherent
*   AI tools unable to generate desired result after 3 attempts
*   Motion/physics breaks too severe to fix
*   Style drift so significant it breaks film continuity

1.4 CONSISTENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Consistency Dashboard
Create a master spreadsheet tracking every shot's consistency metrics:
| Scene | Shot | Type | Character | Location | Color | Lighting | Status | Issues | Regen Count | Lock Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1001 | 101 | WS | Vanguard | 100% | 98% | 100% | LOCKED | None | 0 | 10/25/25 |
| 1001 | 102 | MS | Priests | N/A | 95% | 98% | LOCKED | Minor | 0 | 10/25/25 |
| 1001 | 103 | CU | Vanguard | 100% | 100% | 100% | LOCKED | None | 0 | 10/25/25 |

Color Coding:
*   Green (95-100%): Locked, excellent
*   Yellow (85-94%): Acceptable variance
*   Orange (75-84%): Needs review
*   Red (<75%): Requires regeneration

Version Control System
Every asset must have:
1.  Unique ID: [SHOT]_[SCENE]_[SHOT#]_[VERSION]
2.  Metadata File: JSON with prompt, parameters, issues
3.  Folder Structure: Organized by scene, then shot, then version
Example:
/01_STORYBOARDS/
  /Scene_001_Desert_Summon/
    /Shots/
      /v1_generated/
        - shot_001_v1_wide_desert.png
        - shot_001_v1_metadata.json
      /v2_refined/
        - shot_001_v2_wide_desert.png (if regenerated)
      /LOCKED/
        - shot_001_final.png (final locked version)
