# PART 3: MIDJOURNEY CONSISTENCY FORMULA

## 🎯 **ACHIEVING 95%+ CHARACTER CONSISTENCY**

### **The --cref Parameter**

This is the MOST IMPORTANT parameter for consistency.

**Syntax:**
\`\`\`
--cref [IMAGE_URL]
\`\`\`

**What it does:**
Links your shot to a canonical character reference, forcing Midjourney to match that character's face.

### **Example Usage:**

**WITHOUT --cref (inconsistent):**
\`\`\`
/imagine prompt: Vanguard standing in hallway
--ar 21:9 --v 6.1
\`\`\`
Result: Different-looking Vanguard every time ❌

**WITH --cref (consistent):**
\`\`\`
/imagine prompt: Vanguard standing in hallway
--ar 21:9 --v 6.1 --cref https://cdn.midjourney.com/[your-vanguard-url]
\`\`\`
Result: Same Vanguard every time ✅

### **The --cw Parameter (Character Weight)**

Controls how strongly to match reference.

**Range:** 0-100  
**Default:** 100 (maximum consistency)

**When to use different values:**

**--cw 100:** Face close-ups, dialogue scenes (exact match)  
**--cw 60-80:** Medium shots with clothing changes  
**--cw 20-40:** Distant shots, crowd scenes

### **5-Shot Consistency Test**

Before using any canonical reference in production:

1. Generate 5 test shots using --cref
2. Use different prompts (angles, lighting, poses)
3. Compare all 5 to canonical reference
4. Score consistency (face match, key features)
5. If 4+ out of 5 match (95%+) → APPROVED ✅

**Example Test:**

\`\`\`
Test 1: [Character] close-up face, frontal
Test 2: [Character] profile angle
Test 3: [Character] sitting at table
Test 4: [Character] walking toward camera
Test 5: [Character] in dark dramatic lighting
\`\`\`

If all 5 look like the SAME person → Reference works!

### **Consistency Checklist (Every Shot)**

Before approving character shot:

- [ ] --cref parameter included?
- [ ] Correct character URL used?
- [ ] --cw value appropriate (usually 100)?
- [ ] Face matches reference (95%+)?
- [ ] Key features correct (armor color, goatee, etc.)?
- [ ] Aspect ratio correct (--ar 21:9)?

If ANY fails → Regenerate
