## 📱 SOCIAL MEDIA MILESTONES

Post these updates to build audience:

1. **Oct 22:** "Day 1 of THE VANGUARD! Just generated my first shot. 429 to go! #AIFilmmaking"
2. **Oct 28:** "Week 1 complete! First scene done (8 shots). This is really happening! 🎬"
3. **Dec 16:** "ACT ONE COMPLETE! 120 shots generated. One-third of the way there! 💪"

---

## 🎯 EMERGENCY ADJUSTMENTS

**If falling behind schedule:**
- Reduce daily shot count (5 instead of 10)
- Extend timeline by 4-8 weeks
- Skip some template-based shots (use simpler alternatives)

**If ahead of schedule:**
- Add additional polish shots
- Generate B-roll/cutaways
- Start video generation earlier

**If budget issues:**
- Use free AI tools (Stable Diffusion instead of Midjourney)
- Reduce VFX complexity
- DIY music composition (free tools)

---

## ✅ DAILY SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Each day counts as SUCCESS if you:**
1. Generated at least 1 shot (even if takes 5 attempts)
2. Updated your shot tracker
3. Made progress toward weekly goal

**DON'T QUIT if:**
- A shot takes 10 attempts (normal!)
- Character consistency is hard at first (gets easier!)
- You miss a daily session (just continue next day)

**The only failure is stopping.**
