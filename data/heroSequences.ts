PRODUCTION NOTES
VFX Budget Estimate: $800-1200
• Neural tendrils CG: $500 (After Effects + Houdini)
•
Skin deformation practical: $200 (makeup effects)

PRODUCTION NOTES
Horror Balance: Room 195 is THREATENING, not explicitly torturing. Show:
• Surgical instruments (implication)
•
Blood stains (past violence)
• Restraints (captivity)
• NOT actual torture (Duncan doesn't hurt Jackson - just intimidates)
Timeline: 1 week (practical set + horror lighting)
HERO SEQUENCE 9: LABORATORY BLOOD SYNTHESIS
Scene 028 | Pages 41-43 | Runtime: 2 minutes
Duncan Crosses Moral Line - Villain Emerging
SEQUENCE OVERVIEW
Narrative Function: Duncan forces scientist to synthesize temporal blood. Moral boundary crossed. Villain
emerging from grief.
Visual Style: Clinical. Scientific. Cold. Oppressive authority.
Technical Challenge: Microscope footage (cells moving backward), medical equipment accuracy, Duncan's
intimidation.
Emotional Arc: Scientific curiosity → Obsession → Threat → Moral line crossed
KEY SHOTS (5 Essential)
SHOT 028-A: CLOSE-UP - MICROSCOPE VIEW (TEMPORAL CELLS)
Duration: 10 seconds

FLICKERING (existence unstable). Some SPLITTING then UNMERGING. Temporal anomalies.
AI PROMPT (Essential):
MICROSCOPE VIEW: Extreme close-up. Blood cells (red, circular, organic). ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR: Some cells
moving BACKWARD (reverse direction). Some FLICKERING (appear/disappear rapidly). Some SPLITTING then
RECOMBINING (reverse mitosis). Temporal physics violation.
THIS IS SCI-FI CONCEPT VISUAL: Cells that don't obey causality.
Style: Medical textbook + sci-fi concept + The Fly (biological horror).
Technical: Macro medical view, cells VFX (After Effects + Houdini particles), reverse motion, flicker effects, medical
aesthetic, film grain.
--ar 21:9 --style raw --v 6.1 --chaos 40

SHOT 028-D: MEDIUM - DUNCAN PULLS OUT SYRINGE
Duration: 8 seconds
Description: Duncan reaches into coat. Pulls out SYRINGE (already prepared - he planned this). Scientist's
face: horror realization.
AI PROMPT (Essential):
MEDIUM SHOT: Duncan's hand pulling syringe from lab coat pocket. Syringe already prepared (empty, ready for blood
draw). Scientist visible background (reacting - horrified).
THIS IS MORAL BOUNDARY: Duncan planned to use his own blood (obsession complete).
Technical: Medium 50mm, syringe prominent, scientist reaction visible, ominous, film grain.
--ar 21:9 --style raw --v 6.1 --cref [Duncan_Canonical_Reference]
SHOT 028-E: CLOSE-UP - BLOOD DRAWN (DARK)
Duration: 10 seconds
Description: Scientist drawing Duncan's blood. Syringe filling with DARK blood (too dark - unnatural
viscosity). Duncan watching (obsessed). Ominous.
AI PROMPT (Essential):
CLOSE-UP: Syringe filling with Duncan's blood. Blood DARK (almost black - unnatural viscosity). Flowing slowly
(thick). Duncan's arm visible (needle in vein). Scientist's hands shaking (reluctant).
THIS IS VISUAL FORESHADOWING: Duncan's blood is wrong (already corrupted? destined for temporal
experiments?).
Technical: Close-up 85mm, macro detail, dark blood practical (dark corn syrup), ominous lighting, film grain.
--ar 21:9 --style raw --v 6.1 --cref [Duncan_Canonical_Reference]
Art Direction: Dark blood = practical (dark corn syrup + food coloring = viscous dark red)

visualization.

NEXT STEPS
You Now Have:
Act One complete (your previous work - 120 shots)
All 9 hero sequences detailed (80+ critical shots)
Production roadmap complete
Still Needed:
Remaining standard scenes (dialogue, transitions, reactions)
☑ Template library for standard shots
Updated technical specifications
Recommended Next Action:
Start generating hero sequences immediately while I create template library for remaining shots.
Parallel workflow = maximum efficiency:
•
You: Generate hero sequences (use these breakdowns)
• Me: Create template library for standard scenes (next delivery)
QUESTIONS?
• Any hero sequence need more detail?
• Any technical approach unclear?
• Ready for template library next?
• Want to start generating immediately?
