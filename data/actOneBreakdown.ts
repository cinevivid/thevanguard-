SHOT 001-A: AERIAL ESTABLISHING - ALIEN SKY
Shot Type: EXTREME WIDE - AERIAL
Duration: 5 seconds
Description: Camera looks down from high above. Two moons visible in purple-black sky. Strange
constellations. Dying orange sun on horizon. Desert landscape stretches endlessly.
AI GENERATION PROMPT:
SHOT_001_A // EXTREME WIDE AERIAL ESTABLISHING
LOCATION: Alien desert planet at night. Camera positioned 500 feet above ground, looking down at vast desert
landscape. Two crescent moons visible in deep purple-black sky (one larger, one smaller). Unfamiliar star constellations -
NOT Earth patterns. Dying orange sun barely visible on horizon, creating orange rim light. Desert sand is dark gray-
brown, not Earth yellow. Ancient biomechanical ruins scattered in distance (weathered, alien architecture). Wind blowing
sand particles visible as atmospheric haze.
CINEMATOGRAPHY: Extreme wide aerial shot, looking straight down with slight horizon visible. Slow descent toward
ground (2-second push-in). Camera stable, cinematic quality. Depth of field: Everything in focus (deep focus).
LIGHTING: Moonlight as key light (cool blue-white, HEX: #a8c8e8, from upper left). Dying sun provides orange rim
light on horizon (HEX: #ff9500). Atmospheric god rays through dust particles. High contrast between moonlit areas and
deep shadows.
COLOR PALETTE: Deep blue night sky (#1a1f2d), gray-brown sand (#4a4a4a), moonlight silver (#e8e8e8), orange sun
(#ff9500), purple shadows (#2d2a3d).
STYLE REFERENCE: Dune (2021) desert establishing shots. Blade Runner 2049 scale and atmosphere. Contemplative,
mysterious, alien but beautiful.
VISUAL ELEMENTS: Visible wind (sand particles in air), volumetric atmosphere (god rays), sharp stars, two distinct
moons with visible craters/surface detail.
MOOD: Ominous, mysterious, cosmic scale. Viewer should feel small and uncertain.
Technical specs: Anamorphic widescreen framing (2.39:1), 4K resolution, cinematic color grading (teal and orange), film
grain subtle.
--ar 21:9 --style raw --v 6.1
Character References: None (establishing environment)
Location References: Desert Master Plan v1
Technical Notes:
• Two moons must be clearly visible and distinct sizes
•
Avoid Earth-like sky colors (no bright blue)
• Sand should not look like Sahara (darker, more alien)
•
Ruins should be barely visible (atmospheric, not prominent)
Sound Design:
• Ambient: Low alien wind (40Hz rumble with high whistle overtones)
•
SFX: Sand particles hitting microphone (soft ticking)
• Music: None yet (pure atmosphere)
Continuity Notes:
• Establishes alien world (two moons will appear in later shots)
•
This moon configuration is canonical for all desert scenes
• Orange sun position sets time of day (late evening/dusk)
SHOT 001-B: GROUND LEVEL - RISING SAND CIRCLE
Shot Type: WIDE - GROUND LEVEL

(human eye level). Static camera. Depth of field: Circle in sharp focus, priests in focus, background slightly soft
(atmospheric depth).
LIGHTING: Moonlight from above (cool blue-white key). Staff glow provides colored fill light on priests' faces and
robes. Rising sand circle emits blue-white underglow. High contrast. Volumetric light beams from staffs.
COLOR PALETTE: Dark desert (#2a2a2a), moonlight (#a8c8e8), staff glows (green #00ff88, blue #0088ff, red #ff0044),
sand circle underglow (blue-white #c8e8ff).
STYLE REFERENCE: Dune ritual scenes (mysterious, ceremonial). Doctor Strange mystical effects (energy and
precision). Arrival alien language reveals (cosmic scale, incomprehensible power).
VISUAL ELEMENTS: Sand falling upward into circle, rotation visible (slow, 5 RPM), energy crackling at circle edges,
staff light beams visible in atmospheric dust, wind blowing robes.
MOOD: Ritualistic, powerful, otherworldly. The priests are performing something beyond human understanding.

--ar 21:9 --style raw --v 6.1
Character References: Priest designs (to be generated as hero assets first)
Location References: Desert Master Plan v1
Technical Notes:
•
Sand circle must be perfectly round (AI often generates oval)
•
Three priests at exactly 120° spacing (verify in generation)
•
Staff colors LOCKED: Green, Blue, Red (never change)
• Rotation should be visible but slow (not spinning rapidly)
Sound Design:
• Ambient: Wind continues (now with energy hum underneath)
•
SFX: Deep bass HUM from rising circle (80Hz sustained)
• SFX: Sand cascade sound (reversed waterfall)
•
SFX: Energy crackle (electrical, low intensity)

• Energy should spread from dial outward (animated effect)
Technical Notes:
• This begins the time travel effect (building to climax)
•
Blue energy is time travel "signature" throughout film
•
Dial rotation must be visible (clockwise = backward in time)
Sound Design:
• SFX: Dial mechanical click-click-click (ratcheting)
• SFX: Energy surge building (rising pitch 100Hz to 1kHz)
• SFX: Electrical crackling (Tesla coil sound)
• SFX: Armor resonance (metallic hum)
• Music: Dramatic swell (orchestral)
Continuity Notes:
•
This activation sequence is template for all time travel events
• Blue energy + electrical discharge = time travel signature
•
Establishes the visual language of temporal displacement
SHOT 001-J: LIGHTNING STRIKE - WIDE
Shot Type: EXTREME WIDE
Duration: 1 second (impact frame)
Description: Lightning bolt strikes Vanguard from sky. Massive electrical discharge. Single frame impact.
AI GENERATION PROMPT:
SHOT_001_J // EXTREME WIDE - LIGHTNING IMPACT
LOCATION: Alien desert night, sand circle ritual site.
SCENE: Massive lightning bolt striking from sky directly onto Vanguard. Bolt is 50+ feet wide at base, branching fractals
extending upward into clouds. Vanguard at center of impact, completely obscured by white-blue electrical energy.
Shockwave of light expanding outward, blowing sand in circular pattern. Priests visible at circle edge, being blown
backward by shockwave, robes billowing. Sand circle glowing white-hot at impact point.
CINEMATOGRAPHY: Extreme wide shot, camera positioned 200 feet back, looking at entire ritual site. High angle
(slightly elevated). Captures full scale of lightning strike. Camera static (frozen moment). Depth of field: Everything in
focus (capture full scene detail).
LIGHTING: Lightning bolt is brightest element (overexposed white-blue #ffffff), creating silhouettes of everything else.
Shockwave of light expanding (gradient from white center to blue edges). Moonlight completely overwhelmed. Shadows
cast outward from center. High contrast black and white with blue tint.
COLOR PALETTE: Lightning white-blue (#ffffff to #88ccff), shockwave blue (#4488ff), silhouettes black (#000000),
sand blown white-gray (#e8e8e8), residual green/red/blue from staff glow (barely visible).
STYLE REFERENCE: Thor lightning strikes (massive power). Godzilla atomic breath impact (shockwave). Nuclear
explosion test footage (overwhelming light). Akira explosion scenes (frozen moment of impact).

• Use practical lightning stock footage + color grade to match
•
Shockwave is animated element (particle system)
Technical Notes:
• This is the most VFX-heavy shot of the opening
• Single frame impact (held for 1 second) = freeze-frame effect
• Overexposure is intentional (overwhelming light)
Sound Design:
• SFX: Lightning crack (massive, 20Hz bass + 10kHz crack)
•
SFX: Thunder roll (immediate, overlapping crack)
•
SFX: Shockwave (subsonic rumble)
• SFX: Wind blast (hurricane force)
• Music: Orchestral hit (sudden silence after)
Continuity Notes:
• This is Vanguard's departure from his timeline
• Visual template for all time travel effects (lightning = temporal displacement)

subtle.
--ar 21:9 --style raw --v 6.1
Technical Notes:
• Purposefully uncinematic (contrast with sci-fi opening)
•
Businessman is "everyman" (not important character, represents collateral damage)
• Generate multiple businessman variations (any appearance works)
Sound Design:
• Ambient: City sounds (traffic, distant sirens, footsteps)
•
SFX: Coffee sloshing in cup
• Music: Subtle tension building (viewer anticipation)
Continuity Notes:

• Option 2: Composite CG ripples over static coffee
• Ripple frequency: 2-3 Hz (visible but not violent)
Technical Notes:
• Homage to Jurassic Park (T-Rex announcement)
•
Establishes time travel disturbance visual language
• Ripples = temporal distortion affecting local physics
Sound Design:
•
SFX: Liquid sloshing (subtle)
•
SFX: Low frequency rumble (20Hz, barely audible - felt more than heard)
• Music: Tension build (strings sustaining)
Continuity Notes:
• First indication something wrong is happening
• Temporal disturbance affects environment before Vanguard appears
•
Will reuse this "ripple effect" motif when time travel occurs
SHOT 002-D: CLOUDS FORMING
Shot Type: WIDE - SKY
Duration: 3 seconds
Description: Sky above skyscraper. Clouds suddenly form in spiral pattern. Unnatural weather.
AI GENERATION PROMPT:

VISUAL ELEMENTS: Spiral cloud formation (tornado-like but in sky), lightning branching between clouds, wind visible
(clouds moving fast), sunlight being swallowed by darkness, birds fleeing (small details add realism), skyscraper reflecting
storm.
MOOD: Ominous, unnatural, impending disaster. Nature itself is wrong.
Technical specs: Anamorphic 2.39:1, wide lens, deep focus, VFX storm (animated clouds), practical lightning, film grain.
--ar 21:9 --style raw --v 6.1
VFX Notes:
•
Cloud formation will need heavy VFX work
• Generate clean sky background + composite animated storm clouds
• Cloud rotation: Use particle system or stock footage time-lapse (sped up)
• Lightning: Stock footage + compositing
Technical Notes:
• Spiral pattern indicates temporal vortex opening
•
Same visual language as desert lightning (time travel signature)
Sound Design:
• SFX: Wind building (howling, 40-80Hz)
•
SFX: Thunder rumbling (approaching storm)
• SFX: Electrical crackling in clouds
• Ambient: City sounds fading (wind drowning out traffic)
• Music: Intensifying (drums, low brass)
Continuity Notes:
•
Storm forming = Vanguard arriving from future
• Same electrical effect as desert departure (visual consistency)
SHOT 002-E: VANGUARD MATERIALIZES (REFLECTION)
Shot Type: MEDIUM
Duration: 3 seconds
Description: Businessman sees Vanguard's reflection materializing in glass building before reality catches up.
Reflection shows future before it happens.
AI GENERATION PROMPT:
SHOT_002_E // MEDIUM - REFLECTION ANOMALY
LOCATION: EXT. GLASS SKYSCRAPER entrance, businessman POV.
SCENE: Modern glass building facade (floor-to-ceiling reflective blue-tinted glass). In the glass reflection: The Vanguard
standing behind camera (reflected in glass) BEFORE he actually exists in physical space. Temporal anomaly: Reflection
appears 2 seconds before reality. Vanguard's green armor visible in reflection, standing still, facing camera. Businessman
visible in reflection (smaller, to the side), frozen in mid-step, looking at the impossible reflection.
CINEMATOGRAPHY: Medium shot, camera from businessman's POV looking at glass building. Glass reflection
dominates frame (mirror image of reality). Camera static. Depth of field: Glass surface in focus (reflection clear),
background through glass (lobby interior) slightly soft.

(#ff3333), sky reflection (storm gray #3a3a3a), businessman reflection (muted colors).
STYLE REFERENCE: Inception mirror scenes (reality distortion). The Matrix glitch effects (reality breaking). Arrival
time anomaly reveals (non-linear time).
VISUAL ELEMENTS: Vanguard reflection perfectly clear (sharp, detailed), subtle shimmer in glass (temporal distortion),
storm clouds reflected in upper glass, reflection slightly displaced from reality (parallax error suggesting time
displacement), businessman frozen (reacting to impossibility).
MOOD: Impossible, terrifying, glitch in reality. Seeing the future before it happens.
Technical specs: Anamorphic 2.39:1, practical glass reflection + composite Vanguard separately, shallow depth of field on
glass surface, film grain.
--ar 21:9 --cref [VANGUARD_CANONICAL_IMAGE] --style raw --v 6.1
VFX Notes:
• Composite Vanguard into reflection separately
•
Reflection should be perfectly clear (not distorted like normal reflections)
• Add subtle shimmer/distortion at edges (temporal anomaly)
Technical Notes:
•
CRITICAL SHOT: Establishes that time travel creates "preview" effect
• Reflection before reality = time is displaced
•
This visual motif may repeat in later time travel scenes
Sound Design:
•
SFX: Glass resonance (low hum, 200Hz)
• SFX: Temporal distortion (electronic warble, phasing)
•
SFX: Businessman's breath (shocked inhale)
• Music: Sudden sharp note (realization moment)
Continuity Notes:
• Reflection anomaly = temporal displacement side effect
• Businessman sees this (establishes he's a witness)

• Darkness = pre-dawn (soldiers waking before sun)
SHOT 003-C: WHISTLE BLAST - LIGHTS SLAM ON
Shot Type: WIDE
Duration: 1 second (sudden impact)
Description: Whistle screams. Fluorescent lights slam on. Soldiers jump from beds.
AI GENERATION PROMPT:
SHOT_003_C // WIDE - BARRACKS WAKE-UP
LOCATION: INT. ARMY BARRACKS SLEEPING QUARTERS. Large dormitory-style room. Metal bunk beds (rows of
10+ beds). Concrete floor, industrial aesthetic. Fluorescent overhead lights (just turned on - bright, harsh). Windows
showing predawn darkness outside.
CHARACTERS: 20+ soldiers (male and female, diverse, ages 18-25) jumping from bunks. Most in underwear/PT shorts
and t-shirts. Reactions: Startled, groggy, trained response (muscle memory). Feet hitting floor simultaneously. Creating
chaos and motion.
JAMIE JACKSON visible center frame (bottom bunk, frame-right). Tangled in sheets, slower to respond, disoriented. Hair
messy, dark circles under eyes, exhausted.
CINEMATOGRAPHY: Wide shot, camera at ground level end of barracks looking down rows of bunks. Symmetrical
composition (bunk rows creating leading lines). Camera static. Depth of field: Entire scene in focus (capture full chaos).
LIGHTING: Overhead fluorescent lights (just switched on - bright, harsh, 5600K). Sudden change from darkness
(previous shot) to harsh brightness. Windows show darkness outside (contrast). High key lighting (minimal shadows,
institutional).
COLOR PALETTE: Fluorescent white-yellow (#ffeaa7), concrete floor gray (#8a8a8a), bunk metal gray (#бабаба),
military sheets olive-green (#4a6d3a), soldiers' skin tones (diverse), Jackson's white t-shirt, windows dark blue-gray
(#1a2a3a).
STYLE REFERENCE: Full Metal Jacket (barracks authenticity). Jarhead (military brutality). An Officer and a Gentleman
(training atmosphere).
VISUAL ELEMENTS: Soldiers mid-jump (motion blur), sheets flying, feet hitting floor (dust particles kicked up),
fluorescent lights bright (slight bloom effect), Jackson struggling (slower than others), Drill Sergeant silhouette at entrance
(background, barely visible), military efficiency vs Jackson's struggle.
MOOD: Chaos, institutional brutality, Jackson's failure already visible.
Technical specs: Anamorphic 2.39:1, practical fluorescent overhead (harsh lighting), motion blur on fast movement, film
grain.
--ar 21:9 --style raw --v 6.1
Technical Notes:
• Jackson should be noticeably behind others (visual storytelling)
• Symmetrical bunk rows = institutional dehumanization
•
Sudden light = visual shock (audience experiences wake-up)
Sound Design:
• SFX: WHISTLE BLAST (piercing, sharp, loud - audience should flinch)
•
SFX: Fluorescent lights buzzing on (electric hum, sudden)
• SFX: 20+ feet hitting floor simultaneously (thunderous THUD)
•
SFX: Metal bunks creaking
• SFX: Sheets rustling (chaos)
• Ambient: Predawn quiet shattering
• Music: Sudden percussion hit (mirrors whistle impact)
Continuity Notes:
• Whistle = military authority (Drill Sergeant controlling soldiers)
•
Jackson's slower response = foreshadowing her failure
• Barracks setting = Jackson's current life (about to escape this)
MONTAGE NOTE:
Shots 003-D through 003-G constitute a rapid 45-second montage showing Jackson's repeated failures. Quick
cuts, no dialogue, visual storytelling only. Music drives pacing.
SHOT 003-D: JACKSON PUKING (MORNING)
Shot Type: CLOSE-UP
Duration: 3 seconds (montage beat)
Description: Jackson bent over trash can, puking. Exhausted, sick.
AI GENERATION PROMPT:
SHOT_003_D // CLOSE-UP - PUKING #1
LOCATION: INT. BARRACKS BATHROOM - MORNING
CHARACTER: Jamie Jackson, bent over metal trash can. Face flushed, sweating, dark circles under eyes. Hair falling in
face. Eyes watering. Mid-vomit (motion captured - head jerking forward).
TRASH CAN: Metal military trash can, visible in foreground (bottom frame).
CINEMATOGRAPHY: Close-up, camera at Jackson's eye level (close to her face). Slightly angled (not direct profile, not
straight-on - dynamic). Camera static. Depth of field: Jackson's face in sharp focus, trash can in mid-focus, background
bathroom soft blur.
LIGHTING: Harsh fluorescent bathroom lighting (overhead, unflattering). No makeup, raw reality. Skin tone washed out
by bright light. Shadows under eyes emphasized.
COLOR PALETTE: Skin flushed (#d4725a), hair dark brown (#3d2817), trash can metal gray (#8a8a8a), fluorescent
lighting (#ffd966), bathroom tiles white (#f5f5f5), vomit (barely visible, yellowish).
STYLE REFERENCE: Requiem for a Dream (brutal reality, no glamorization). Trainspotting (physical degradation). Full
Metal Jacket (military harshness).
VISUAL ELEMENTS: Sweat on forehead, hair wet/stringy, eyes bloodshot, slight motion blur (head movement), harsh
lighting (every imperfection visible), exhaustion physically manifested.
MOOD: Misery, physical failure, human vulnerability. Jackson is not superhero material.
Technical specs: Anamorphic 2.39:1, handheld slight shake (realism), harsh fluorescent practical light, no beauty filters
(raw realism), film grain.
--ar 21:9 --style raw --v 6.1
Technical Notes:
•
FIRST of three puking scenes (motif = Jackson's recurring failure)
• No glamorization (not movie-pretty puking - realistic)
• Audience sees protagonist at lowest point
Sound Design:
• SFX: Retching sounds (realistic, unpleasant)
• SFX: Vomit hitting trash can (liquid impact)
•
SFX: Jackson gasping between heaves
• SFX: Fluorescent buzz (constant background)
• Music: Montage track building (drums, driving rhythm)
Continuity Notes:
• Puking #1 of 3 (establishes pattern)
• Physical manifestation of Jackson not fitting military life
• Visceral, unglamorous (subverts action hero tropes)
(Due to length, I'll continue creating the remaining Act One scenes and then compile everything into the outputs
folder. This is just a preview of the level of detail being provided for every single shot of the entire 90-page
screenplay.)
Let me now compile what I've created so far and prepare to continue building out the complete technical bible
with Acts Two and Three...
