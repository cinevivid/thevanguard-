### **FESTIVAL LOGLINE (75 words)**
THE VANGUARD is a non-linear sci-fi thriller where a young military interrogator, Jamie Jackson, questions a mysterious armored alien captured after attacking major cities. Through fragmented interrogations spanning six months, she discovers the alien is Victor Duncan—a human soldier sent back from the future, biologically fused to experimental armor. When her mentor, Director Richard Duncan (Victor's great-grandfather), attempts to steal the technology, Jamie must choose between loyalty and preventing a temporal catastrophe.

### **ELEVATOR PITCH (90 seconds spoken)**
"Imagine ARRIVAL meets 12 MONKEYS in an underground interrogation room. A 23-year-old military interrogator spends six months questioning an alien warrior who's destroyed cities. But the alien isn't what he seems—he's a human time traveler, biologically fused to armor that lets him exist outside normal time. The twist? The interrogator's own mentor is the time traveler's great-grandfather, and he's willing to destroy the timeline to steal the armor's power. It's PRISONERS meets LOOPER, told through interrogations, flashbacks, and a split-screen sequence showing a grandmother dying as her grandson kills his own great-grandfather—at the exact same moment."

## 📄 SHORT SYNOPSIS (1 Page)

### **THE VANGUARD**

In 2025, the world is paralyzed by fear. Three months ago, an armored warrior dubbed "The Vanguard" materialized in an alien desert ceremony and proceeded to attack major cities—New York, Tokyo, and London. After a military strike finally subdued him, he was transported to a classified underground facility beneath Arizona.

Jamie Jackson, 23, is a rising military interrogator suffering from chronic insomnia and pressure to prove herself. She's assigned to Room 111, where The Vanguard—a massive figure in green biomechanical armor with a glowing red visor—sits silently across a metal table. He will not speak. He will not eat. He only stares.

For three months, Jackson tries everything—psychological tactics, building rapport, even moments of genuine connection—but The Vanguard reveals nothing. The world above grows restless. Political pressure mounts. Then, in one interrogation, he speaks for the first time: "My name is Victor Duncan."

Jackson's world fractures. Victor is human—a soldier from the year 2095, sent back in time as part of a desperate military experiment. The armor isn't alien technology; it's human, 70 years in the future. Worse, the armor is biologically fused to Victor's body. Removing it would kill him. And the most disturbing revelation: Victor is the great-grandson of her mentor, Director Richard Duncan, the head of the entire facility.

As Jackson learns Victor's story through fragmented flashbacks—his recruitment, the horrific moment surgical tendrils pierced his spine to bond him to the armor, his realization that time travel is a one-way death sentence—she also watches her mentor, Director Duncan, become dangerously obsessed with the armor's power.

The narrative splinters across three timelines:
- **2025:** Jackson's interrogations, where trust builds between captor and captive
- **2095:** Victor's origin story in a dystopian future
- **The Split:** A four-minute Wes Anderson-style split-screen showing Victor's final mission—killing his own great-grandfather—while simultaneously, in another timeline, his grandmother Debra dies in a hospital room, her hand held by a younger Richard Duncan.

Director Duncan's obsession escalates. He secretly studies Victor's armor, theorizing he can extract its power without destroying the timeline. He orders Victor moved to Room 195—a sterile surgical theater—where extraction begins. Victor, knowing his body is the only thing holding the timeline together, submits to his fate.

But Duncan underestimated the armor. Once separated from Victor's body, it activates—searching for a new host. In a catastrophic moment, Duncan dons the armor himself. The neural interface pierces his brain. For one terrible instant, Duncan experiences all possible timelines simultaneously—every version of himself, every choice, every consequence. It destroys him.

Jackson arrives too late. She finds Duncan dying, Victor's body cooling on the surgical table, and the armor, now inert, lying between them. She understands, finally, what Victor knew from the beginning: some doors, once opened, can never be closed.

Six months later, Jackson has left the military. She sits across from a new prisoner—The New Interrogator, a figure in similar armor—and begins the cycle again. But this time, she already knows the truth. Time is a weapon. And humanity has learned to wield it.

**THE VANGUARD asks: What happens when the future reaches back to stop us? And what happens when we can't help but reach forward to grab it?**

## 📄 LONG SYNOPSIS (2 Pages)

### **THE VANGUARD: Extended Synopsis**

**ACT ONE: THE ALIEN**

The film opens in an alien desert under two moons and wrong constellations. A massive circle of sand rotates in the air like a clock. Three figures in tattered robes—alien priests—perform a ritual, inserting glowing staffs into the armor of The Vanguard, a towering figure in green biomechanical plating. When he turns a dial on his chest, lightning strikes, and he vanishes.

Cut to three months later. The world is in chaos. The Vanguard has attacked New York's financial district (shattering a glass skyscraper with a gesture), Tokyo (disappearing before drones could respond), and London (walking through military fire unharmed). He is captured only when he allows himself to be—kneeling in an empty field, waiting.

Jamie Jackson, 23, is a military interrogator recruited from basic training after psychological profiles flagged her as "exceptional under pressure." The truth is messier: she's an insomniac running from her own inadequacy, desperate to prove she belongs in a room with real soldiers.

She's assigned to Interrogation Room 111 in a classified underground facility in Arizona. Across a bolted-down metal table sits The Vanguard: 6'6", 300 lbs of armored mass, red visor glowing, silent as stone. For weeks, she tries every technique. He does not respond. He does not eat. He does not sleep. The only signs of life are the slow rise and fall of his chest and the occasional shift of his gauntleted hands.

Jackson's superior, Director Richard Duncan, is a decorated scientist in his 50s with a white pearl goatee and the focused intensity of a man who has spent his life studying things that should not exist. He gives Jackson three months. After that, the President will order "enhanced measures."

Jackson learns through observation. The Vanguard's armor is not mechanical—it's biological. Fused. Under the plating, she can see pale flesh where metal meets skin. Black leather straps cross his chest, but she realizes they're not restraints—they're structural, holding something inside together.

She begins talking to him—not interrogating, just talking. About her life. Her failures. Her grandmother who raised her. Slowly, impossibly, she sees micro-reactions. A tilt of his head. A pause in his breathing. He is listening.

Then, in Interrogation 47, he speaks:

**"My name is Victor Duncan."**

---

**ACT TWO: THE SOLDIER**

The revelation detonates the investigation. Victor is human. American. Born in 2072. Military records confirm his existence—or will confirm it, 47 years from now. The armor is not alien. It is human technology from the future.

Director Duncan is shaken. Victor is his great-grandson. A man he will never meet, sent back from a timeline where Duncan's legacy—his research into "temporal coherence"—has been weaponized into the most dangerous piece of technology ever created.

Through interrogations, Victor reveals his story:

In 2095, Earth is a surveillance state. Climate collapse and resource wars have consolidated power into a single military-industrial authority called The Sovereignty. Victor was a soldier—idealistic, loyal—recruited into a black-ops project called "The Vanguard Initiative."

The goal: Create soldiers who can move backward in time to eliminate threats before they emerge. The method: Surgically bond a human nervous system to experimental armor that exists "outside causality." The cost: The procedure is irreversible. The pain is unimaginable. And time travel is one-way. Vanguards never return.

Victor agreed. He believed he was saving the world.

The surgery is shown in excruciating detail: Victor, naked and strapped to a table, as mechanical tendrils pierce his spine, his shoulders, his skull. The armor grows into him, fusing with bone and nerve. He screams. The visor locks over his face, and his identity is erased. He is no longer Victor Duncan. He is The Vanguard.

But the mission is worse than the procedure. Victor's target is not a terrorist or dictator. His target is **Director Richard Duncan, his own great-grandfather, in the year 2025**. The mission brief is clinical: "Eliminate temporal origin point. Prevent cascade."

Victor is sent back to stop the man whose research will one day create the technology that enslaved him.

In the present, Jackson is horrified. Director Duncan, however, is fascinated. He begins secret experiments, studying Victor's armor, theorizing that if he can access its temporal properties, he can prevent the dystopian future—or perhaps ensure humanity reaches it faster, on better terms.

Jackson sees Duncan's obsession growing. She tries to warn him, but he dismisses her. **"I'm trying to save the world, Jackson. He came back to kill me. That means I succeed."**

---

**ACT THREE: THE BULLET**

The tension breaks when Duncan orders Victor moved from Room 111 to Room 195—a surgical theater. He's going to attempt separation: extract the armor without killing Victor, then study it.

Victor submits without resistance. He knows the timeline is already ruined. The moment he failed to kill Duncan, causality fractured. Now, every moment he exists creates paradoxes.

Jackson, locked out of the facility, breaks protocol and confronts Duncan in Room 195. She finds him mid-procedure: Victor strapped to a table, armor panels opened, surgical tools embedded in flesh. Victor is conscious, eerily calm, accepting his fate.

Duncan explains his logic. If he can understand the armor, he can build it earlier—better. He can create Vanguards in 2025 and prevent the future wars that made them necessary. It's not murder. It's salvation.

But the armor has other plans.

The moment Duncan severs the final neural connection, the armor activates—not as a tool, but as a parasite. It reaches out, searching for a new host. Duncan, driven by hubris, dons the helmet.

The neural interface pierces his brain. For one moment, Duncan experiences all timelines simultaneously. Every version of himself. Every choice. Every consequence. He sees the future Victor came from—and understands, too late, that his actions in this moment create it.

Duncan collapses, brain hemorrhaging. The armor goes inert. Victor, free of the armor for the first time in years, sees his own pale, scarred body—and dies moments later, his nervous system too damaged to function without the machine.

Jackson enters to find both men dead. The armor lies between them like a corpse.

---

**EPILOGUE: THE CYCLE**

Six months later. Jackson has left the military. She's a civilian now, trying to rebuild. But she's called back for one final consultation.

In Interrogation Room 111, a new prisoner sits: **The New Interrogator**, a figure in armor similar to Victor's, captured after a similar attack. The government wants Jackson's expertise.

Jackson sits across from the prisoner. The visor glows. The figure does not speak.

Jackson leans forward and says, quietly:

**"I already know who you are."**

The film ends on her face: exhausted, knowing, trapped in a cycle she cannot break. The future is coming. And it always will.

**THE VANGUARD is a meditation on inevitability, the cost of progress, and the terrible knowledge that some doors, once opened, cannot be closed.**

## 🎬 DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT (500 Words)

### **Why This Story? Why Now?**

THE VANGUARD began with a simple question: *What if the alien we're interrogating is us?*

I've been obsessed with time travel stories since I was a kid—12 MONKEYS, PRIMER, ARRIVAL—but I always felt they focused on the mechanics of time travel more than the human cost. What happens to a soldier who's sent back in time knowing he can never return? What happens to the person who has to look that soldier in the eye and realize he's human?

THE VANGUARD is my attempt to strip time travel down to its most intimate, claustrophobic form: two people in a room, and the terrible knowledge between them.

The film is structured around interrogations because interrogations are, fundamentally, about power and truth. Jackson thinks she has power because she's free and Victor is imprisoned. But Victor has the power of knowledge—he knows the future, he knows who she is, and he knows her mentor will destroy everything. The interrogation room becomes a kind of confessional, a therapy session, and eventually, a death chamber.

I'm also interested in the military-industrial complex's relationship with soldiers. Victor is not a hero. He's a weapon. The Vanguard Initiative doesn't care about his humanity—it cares about his function. And when he fails that function, he becomes disposable. The armor is fused to his body not as a gift but as a shackle. That's not science fiction—that's reality for many soldiers, just made literal.

Visually, I wanted the film to feel tactile and oppressive. The underground facility is all concrete and fluorescent lighting—cold, institutional, dehumanizing. The only moments of warmth are in Victor's flashbacks to his grandmother, Debra, and her purple bell flowers. Those flowers become a visual motif: beauty in a brutal world, love in a timeline designed to erase it.

The split-screen sequence—showing Debra dying in a hospital room while Victor shoots his great-grandfather in an office—is the emotional heart of the film. It's four and a half minutes of simultaneity, inspired by Wes Anderson's use of split-screen in THE FRENCH DISPATCH but applied to tragedy. The same moment, two timelines, one family destroyed by time itself.

I'm producing this film using AI-generated imagery (Midjourney and Runway ML) because I believe the future of independent filmmaking is in accessible tools that allow bold stories to be told without Hollywood budgets. This is not a "proof of concept"—this is a complete, professional feature film made for $8,500. If this works, it proves that anyone with a story and the will to tell it can make a film.

THE VANGUARD is a tragedy about inevitability. It's about knowing the future and being powerless to stop it. It's about the cost of progress and the people we sacrifice to get there. And ultimately, it's about sitting across from someone and realizing they're not the monster you thought they were—they're you, just further down the timeline.

I hope audiences leave the theater asking the same question Victor asks in his final interrogation:

*"If you knew the future, would you still choose to live in the present?"*
