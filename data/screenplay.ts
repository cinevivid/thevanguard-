FADE IN:

EXT. ALIEN DESERT - NIGHT

SUPER: "Somewhere. Somewhen."

Two moons hang in a sky with wrong constellations. A dying sun bleeds orange across the horizon.

AERIAL VIEW - SWEEPING DOWN

A perfect CIRCLE of sand rises into the air. Twenty feet in diameter. Rotating slowly.

Like a clock. Like a target. Like fate itself.

THREE PRIESTS stand at three points of the circle. Biomechanical beings wrapped in tattered robes. Each carries a glowing staff.

GREEN PRIEST (eldest, robotic eye) leads. BLUE PRIEST (half his face circuitry) follows. RED PRIEST (youngest, mechanical hands) trails.

They slam their staffs into sand in unison.

ONE.
TWO.
THREE.

From the darkness beyond the circle, a massive FIGURE emerges.

THE VANGUARD - six-foot-six, three hundred pounds of green armor fused directly to flesh. Black leather straps. Each plate scarred from countless battles.

A walking weapon.

He stops at the circle's edge. Despite his size and power, he KNEELS. Head bowed. Waiting.

BLUE PRIEST raises his staff. Energy crackles along its length.

BLUE PRIEST
You have been chosen for a singular task.

GREEN PRIEST raises his staff.

GREEN PRIEST
To destroy this timeline. To save us from annihilation.

RED PRIEST raises his staff.

RED PRIEST
Kill those responsible. Those who broke causality.
(beat)
Restore the continuum.

The Vanguard raises his head. His visor GLOWS red.

VANGUARD
I accept.

GREEN PRIEST
Then rise, Victor Duncan. And be swift.

The Vanguard stands. The three Priests step forward. Each inserts their staff into SLOTS in his armor.

Energy SURGES through him. His armor lights up like a circuit board.

The Vanguard reaches for a dial on his chest. Turns it slowly.

A sound builds. Low frequency. Rising.

BLUE PRIEST
(to the others)
May we be forgiven.

The Vanguard's hand moves to his shoulder. Another dial. He turns it.

FLASH OF LIGHT—

Lightning strikes from the sky. OBLITERATES him in a blast of white light.

Thunder rolls across the dead desert.

The three Priests stand alone in the burnt circle. Smoke rises where the Vanguard stood.

RED PRIEST
If he succeeds... won't we cease to exist?

BLUE PRIEST gazes up at the wrong stars. At the dying sun.

BLUE PRIEST
If he succeeds... we won't care.

The wind picks up. Sand begins to fill the burnt circle.

FADE TO BLACK.

TITLE CARD: "THE VANGUARD"

The title FRACTURES like broken glass. Pieces scatter.

EXT. GLASS TOWER - DAY

TITLE CARD: "October 12, 2025 - Timeline Alpha"

Morning in a major city. Glass and steel towers reflect the rising sun. One gleaming skyscraper dominates the skyline. Modern. Expensive. Important.

GROUND LEVEL - ENTRANCE

A BUSINESSMAN (30s, suit, briefcase) walks toward the entrance. Coffee in hand. Checking his phone. Normal morning routine.

Suddenly—

The coffee RIPPLES in his cup.

The Businessman looks down, confused.

The coffee ripples again. Like something heavy approaching.

His arm hairs stand on end. Static electricity fills the air.

He looks up—

CLOUDS form above the building. Instantly. Impossibly fast. Spiral pattern. Counter-clockwise. Weather doesn't move like that.

PEOPLE on the street stop. Point. Pull out phones.

PEDESTRIAN
What the hell is that?

WIDE SHOT - THE SKY

Lightning building in the clouds. Crackling. Gathering power.

CLOSE-UP - THE BUSINESSMAN

He sees his reflection in the building's glass facade.

Behind him in the reflection, a FIGURE materializes.

Not in reality. In the reflection FIRST.

The Businessman spins around—

Nothing there.

He looks back at the reflection—

The figure is closer now. Larger. More defined.

Then REALITY catches up with the reflection.

The Vanguard APPEARS. Solid. Real. Standing twenty feet away.

The Businessman drops his coffee. RUNS.

BUSINESSMAN
Jesus Christ—

Other people see the Vanguard now. Screaming. Running in all directions.

The Vanguard doesn't react. Doesn't chase them. He has a job to do.

He approaches the building entrance. Glass doors. Electronic locks.

He stops. Studies the door mechanism with mechanical precision.

Raises his right gauntlet. Places it flat against the glass.

His gauntlet begins to HUM. Low frequency. Rising pitch.

The glass VIBRATES. Faster. Faster.

Then SHATTERS from acoustic resonance alone. No force. Just sound.

Glass rains down like diamonds. The Vanguard walks through.

---

INT. BUILDING LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Marble floors. Modern art. Reception desk. High-end corporate lobby.

A SECURITY GUARD (50s, overweight, nearly retirement age) reaches for his radio—

The Vanguard is already inside. Moving with purpose.

SECURITY GUARD
Sir, you can't—

The Vanguard ignores him. Kneels in the center of the lobby.

From his belt, he pulls a DISK BOMB. Eight inches in diameter. Three concentric rings glowing red.

He places it precisely on the floor. Geometric center of the lobby.

CLOSE-UP - THE VANGUARD'S FINGERS

Adjusting three dials on the bomb. Precise. Mechanical. Each dial clicks into place with certainty.

The bomb BEEPS once. Activated.

The Vanguard stands. Turns. Walks back toward the shattered entrance without looking back.

SECURITY GUARD
(into radio, voice shaking)
We have a—we have an armed individual—

The Vanguard exits the building.

The Guard stares at the bomb. Realization dawning. Panic setting in.

SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
(into radio)
Evacuate. EVACUATE NOW.

---

EXT. GLASS TOWER - CONTINUOUS

The Vanguard stands on the sidewalk. People running past him in terror.

He taps a dial on his chest. The armor begins to glow.

Static electricity fills the air. Papers swirl. Car alarms trigger.

The Vanguard looks up at the storm clouds above.

SMASH CUT TO WHITE—

Lightning strikes. BOOM.

The Vanguard vanishes in a flash of light.

The street is empty now. Just debris. Abandoned coffee cups. Eerie silence.

Inside the lobby, visible through the broken glass entrance—

The bomb sits alone. Three rings glowing red.

BEEP.

CUT TO BLACK.

INT. ARMY BARRACKS - DAY

TITLE CARD: "72 Hours Earlier - Fort Davis, Texas"

CLOSE-UP - RED DIGITAL CLOCK

4:05 AM

Darkness. Rows of bunk beds. Twenty sleeping recruits.

A whistle SCREAMS through the darkness.

Lights SLAM on. Fluorescent. Harsh. Blinding.

Recruits jolt awake. Disoriented. Scrambling.

DRILL SERGEANT (28, buzz cut, career military, intimidating) stands in the doorway. Baton in hand. BANGING it against a metal trash can.

DRILL SERGEANT
LET'S MOVE, PEOPLE! YOU'RE BEING TIMED!

MONTAGE - JACKSON'S FAILURE (45 SECONDS)

A) INT. ARMY BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

JAMIE JACKSON (23, athletic build but exhausted, dark circles under eyes) sits on her bunk. Coughing violently.

The Drill Sergeant marches over.

DRILL SERGEANT
Recruit Jackson! Are you DYING today?!

Jackson grabs the trash can. PUKES inside.

Vomit splashes. Some hits the Drill Sergeant's boots.

JACKSON
(weakly)
I'm sorry, Drill Sergeant.

DRILL SERGEANT
Shut up.

B) EXT. DIRT TRACK - DAY

Dawn breaking. Recruits line up for a run.

The Drill Sergeant blows his whistle. They RUN.

Jackson immediately falls behind. Can't keep pace.

She runs to the side of the track. Falls to her knees. PUKES again.

C) EXT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY

Recruits at firing positions. Paper targets downrange.

DRILL SERGEANT
FIRE!

Shots ring out. Most targets hit.

Jackson's target: Untouched. Every shot missed.

D) INT. ARMY BARRACKS - DAY

The Drill Sergeant kicks open Jackson's trunk with his boot.

Inside: ALCOHOL BOTTLES. Dozens. Some empty. Some full. Cigarette cartons.

The Drill Sergeant stares. Then at Jackson.

She can't meet his eyes.

END MONTAGE

---

INT. ARMY OFFICE - DAY

A desk. Nameplate: "RICHARD PENNY"

RICHARD PENNY (40s, thick mustache, family photos on desk) sits behind it. Smoking a cigar. Reviewing files.

Across from him: DIRECTOR DUNCAN (50s, pearl-white goatee, twirled mustache, sharp intelligent eyes). White lab coat over military uniform.

Duncan looks bored. Checking his watch.

Penny blows smoke toward Duncan. Duncan waves it away, irritated.

PENNY
You know how many projects I manage, Duncan?

DUNCAN
Quite a few, I'd imagine.

PENNY
Four hundred and thirty-seven. Active. Right now.

He points the cigar at Duncan.

PENNY (CONT'D)
So why is yours the ONLY one I know absolutely NOTHING about?

Duncan is silent. Slight smile.

PENNY (CONT'D)
You demand more funding. You starve my other projects. AND you want more personnel? No questions asked?

DUNCAN
You'll read about the good work I do, Richard.

PENNY
When?

DUNCAN
After it's declassified.

Penny shakes his head. Tosses a dossier across the desk.

The dossier slides to a stop in front of Duncan. A photo on the cover: JAMIE JACKSON.

PENNY
Explain this one. You didn't even write notes.

Duncan opens the dossier. Flips through casually. Medical reports. Psych evaluations. Disciplinary record.

He's reading something specific. His eyes narrow with interest.

DUNCAN
She wasn't your best.
(smiles)
Which means she'll be more useful under my department.

Sudden KNOCKING on the door. Sharp. Military precision.

PENNY
Come in!

The door opens. The Drill Sergeant enters. Stands at attention. Salutes.

DRILL SERGEANT
Sir! I have a recruit I recommend be dishonorably discharged, sir!

Penny takes another puff of his cigar. Annoyed at the interruption.

PENNY
I don't have time for this.

Duncan stands. Closes the dossier. Tucks it under his arm.

DUNCAN
Well. Looks like you're busy.

Penny waves him off dismissively.

PENNY
Your requests are approved. But you won't get more from my departments. This is it.

Duncan smiles. Nods once.

DUNCAN
That's all I need.

He leaves. The Drill Sergeant steps aside to let him pass.

The door closes.

---

INT. ARMY BARRACKS - DAY

Jackson sits on her bunk. Head in hands. Muttering to herself.

JACKSON
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid...

The door opens.

Director Duncan enters. Reading her file as he walks.

Jackson sees him. Immediately stands at attention beside her trunk.

Duncan barely glances at her. Still reading.

DUNCAN
The Drill Sergeant was not a fan of you.

Silence. Jackson doesn't know how to respond.

Duncan sighs. Walks over to her trunk. Kicks it open with his foot.

Examines the contents. Bottles. So many bottles. Cigarettes.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
How'd you convince them? Money? Blackmail?

Silence.

JACKSON
(slight smile)
I asked nicely.

Duncan is impressed. He reaches into the trunk.

Pulls out a bottle of cinnamon whiskey. And two small shooters.

Hands one shooter to Jackson.

DUNCAN
Cheers.

They clink glasses. Duncan drinks his in one gulp.

Jackson hesitates briefly. Then drinks. Winces slightly but doesn't cough.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
You're not going to jail. You're being reassigned.

Relief washes over her face. Her shoulders relax.

JACKSON
When do I leave?

DUNCAN
Right now.

Duncan motions toward the door.

They leave together.

---

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

A black car with tinted windows stops in front of a run-down LAUNDROMAT. Neon sign: "24 HOUR WASH & DRY"

Jackson and Duncan exit the car.

Jackson looks around. Confused.

Duncan walks to a MANHOLE COVER in the sidewalk.

Grabs the edge. Lifts it easily. Reveals a ladder descending into darkness.

DUNCAN
Ladies first.

Jackson stares into the dark hole.

JACKSON
You're kidding.

Duncan just smiles and gestures downward.

Jackson takes a breath. Descends the ladder into darkness.

Duncan follows. The manhole cover slides back into place above them with a heavy THUD.

Complete darkness.

---

INT. UNDERGROUND BASE - DAY

Jackson and Duncan climb down the ladder. It's a long descent.

Thirty feet. Forty feet. Fifty feet.

Finally, Jackson's feet touch ground. She steps back.

Looks up.

Her jaw drops.

WIDE SHOT - THE UNDERGROUND BASE

A cathedral-like space. TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH. Brutalist concrete architecture. Soviet-era aesthetics. Oppressive but awe-inspiring.

Scientists in white lab coats and military personnel in brown uniforms move like ants far below.

The scale is overwhelming.

JACKSON
What IS this place?

DUNCAN
Home.

A MILITARY POLICE OFFICER (buzz cut, early 20s, eager) spots Duncan. Snaps to attention. Salutes sharply.

OFFICER
Officer on deck!

All personnel in the immediate area stop their work. Turn. Salute in unison.

DUNCAN
At ease!

They resume their work immediately.

The officer approaches Duncan and Jackson.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Escort me and Specialist Jackson to my office first. Then we'll head to containment.

OFFICER
Yes, sir!

They walk down a long corridor. Gray concrete walls. Exposed pipes. Fluorescent lights buzzing overhead.

---

INT. DUNCAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Small. Sparse. Utilitarian. A desk. Filing cabinets. No windows.

One personal item: A PHOTO FRAME on the desk.

Duncan and an elderly woman. Both smiling. Genuine happiness captured in the photo.

Jackson notices it immediately.

JACKSON
Is that your family?

Duncan's expression softens noticeably. He picks up the photo. Stares at it for a moment.

DUNCAN
My grandmother. Debra.

JACKSON
She looks kind.

DUNCAN
She is.

He sets the photo down gently. Carefully. Back to business mode.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
(clearing throat)
Let's go meet your new best friend.

---

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 515 - DAY (FLASHBACK)

TITLE CARD: "Three Weeks Earlier"

A small, clean hospital room. Bed. TV. Bathroom. Sink. Window overlooking the city skyline.

GRANDMA DUNCAN (elderly, warm smile, frail but spirited) sits in the hospital bed. Flower arrangements on every surface. Purple bell flowers prominent.

Duncan sits beside her. Holding her hand tenderly.

GRANDMA
You're working too hard again.

DUNCAN
Someone has to save the world, Grams.

GRANDMA
(laughs softly)
That's what your mother used to say.

Duncan's smile fades slightly.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
Before every shift at the hospital. "Someone has to save the world." And then one day...

She doesn't finish. Doesn't need to. The implication hangs in the air.

DUNCAN
I'm not like her. I'm careful.

GRANDMA
I know you are, sweetheart.

Beat. She squeezes his hand.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
Promise me something. When you're busy saving the world... don't forget to live in it.

Duncan nods. But they both know he won't keep that promise.

He leans forward. Kisses her forehead gently.

DUNCAN
I love you, Grams.

GRANDMA
Love you too.

Duncan stands. Walks to the door. Stops. Looks back one more time.

She's already asleep. Breathing softly. Peaceful.

He watches her for a long moment. Then leaves quietly.

CUT TO PRESENT:

---

INT. CONTAINMENT HALLWAY - DAY

A narrow corridor. Gray concrete walls. Low ceiling. Claustrophobic atmosphere.

Thick gray doors line both sides of the hallway. Electric lights above each door. Numbered metal tags: 101... 105... 108...

Duncan, Jackson, and the officer walk down the hall. Their footsteps echo.

JACKSON
What crimes did these prisoners commit?

Duncan smiles. Not kindly.

DUNCAN
We're not in the business of justice, Miss Jackson. We're in the business of research and development.
(beat)
Which means they're not prisoners. They're test subjects.

A loud ROAR echoes from behind door 107. Part bear. Part gorilla. Part something else entirely. Inhuman.

The officer readies his weapon instinctively. Jackson steps back. Eyes wide with fear.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
(to officer)
Oh, don't even bother.

Duncan walks up to door 107 calmly. Slams his fist against it three times.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

The roar gets LOUDER. Angrier. More violent.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
God damn it, Margaret! Don't make me come in there!

He kicks the door. THUD. THUD. THUD.

The roar immediately turns into a WHIMPER. Like a crying wolf. Subdued.

Duncan smiles. Satisfied. Continues walking.

JACKSON
What WAS that?!

DUNCAN
Just a subject, Miss Jackson.

They arrive at door 111.

The officer presses buttons on a keypad. Turns a heavy latch. The pressurized door opens with a HISS of escaping air.

They enter.

---

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

A circular amphitheater. Desks and computers arranged in tiers around a central point. Scientists at every station. Monitors everywhere displaying data.

In the center of the room: A large TITANIUM BOX. Thirty feet on each side. Industrial. Imposing. The Vanguard's prison cell.

Duncan, Jackson, and the officer descend steps toward the center.

The officer stays by the exit door. It closes behind them with a heavy THUD. Magnetically sealed.

Jackson looks around nervously. Scientists illuminated by blue computer screens. Serious, focused faces.

They reach the bottom level. A BLUE METAL PLATE surrounds the titanium box. Glowing faintly with electromagnetic energy.

JACKSON
What is this?
(indicating the glowing floor)

DUNCAN
Just a safety precaution.

A JANITOR (older, heavyset, tired-looking) mops his way out of the interrogation room's exit door. His mop bucket is full of RED LIQUID.

Blood.

He sees Duncan. Nods respectfully. Then tightly shuts the door behind him.

Wheels his bucket away without a word.

Jackson stares at the blood in the bucket. Her face goes pale.

Duncan and Jackson reach the observation window. One-way mirror. Heavily reinforced.

THROUGH THE GLASS:

The Vanguard sits at an interrogation table. Motionless. Arms resting on the table. No restraints visible.

Just sitting there. Waiting. Patient.

Jackson stares. Unable to look away.

JACKSON
What... is that?

Duncan smiles slightly.

DUNCAN
He's friendly. Trust me.

JACKSON
Is that an alien?

DUNCAN
I wish. No, he has bones like us. Organs. Blood. Mostly human. Under all that armor.

Jackson studies the Vanguard carefully. His size. His stillness. Deeply unnerving.

JACKSON
And how exactly am I supposed to help?

Duncan reaches into his coat. Pulls out the bottle of cinnamon whiskey from the barracks earlier.

DUNCAN
All I want you to do is have a drink with the nice man.

JACKSON
I'm not qualified for this.

DUNCAN
That's ENTIRELY the point. This guy will see a professional coming a mile away.

Duncan reaches into another pocket. Pulls out an EARPIECE. Places it in Jackson's palm. Curls her fingers around it gently.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
I'll be with you every step of the way.

He smiles. Trying to be reassuring.

Jackson is nervous. She breathes deeply. Closes her eyes. Opens them. Steels herself.

JACKSON
No. You're right. You already helped me with the discharge situation.

DUNCAN
Exactly.

Jackson is still processing all of this. Overwhelmed.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Get some rest. We start cracking this nut tomorrow.

Duncan turns. Walks back up the stairs toward the exit.

Jackson stands alone at the observation window.

She looks through the one-way mirror one more time.

THROUGH THE GLASS:

The Vanguard slowly turns his head. Directly toward her position.

As if he can see through the mirror. As if he knows she's there.

He begins slamming one massive gauntlet against the table. Rhythmic. Deliberate. Menacing.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

Jackson steps back from the window involuntarily.

FADE TO BLACK.

---

INT. JACKSON'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

A small room. Concrete walls. Single bed. Metal locker. Fluorescent light humming overhead.

Jackson lies on the bed. Staring at the ceiling. Can't sleep.

She looks at the earpiece on her nightstand. Picks it up. Examines it in her palm.

Sets it back down carefully.

Closes her eyes. Tries to sleep.

---

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

TITLE CARD: "The Next Morning"

Jackson stands outside the interrogation room door. She's changed into a dark suit. Hair pulled back in a tight bun. Clipboard in hand. Earpiece inserted.

She looks more professional now. But still visibly nervous.

Her earpiece buzzes softly.

DUNCAN (V.O.)
(through earpiece, calm)
Just keep it simple. I'll be with you every step of the way.

Jackson takes a deep breath. Reaches for the door handle.

Opens it slowly.

---

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Jackson enters cautiously.

The blast door closes behind her with a heavy THUD. Magnetically sealed. She's locked in.

The Vanguard sits at the table. Motionless. Doesn't acknowledge her presence.

Jackson approaches slowly. Every step deliberate. Cautious.

She extends her hand across the table. Professional gesture.

JACKSON
My name is Jamie Jackson. I'll be conducting the interview today.

The Vanguard slowly looks up.

HELMET P.O.V. - THE VANGUARD'S VISION

Red filter over everything. Scan lines moving across the image. Digital readout in corners.

A yellow box appears around Jackson. Scanning her systematically.

Text scrolls rapidly: "ANALYZING... BIOMETRIC DATA... DNA SEQUENCE..."

BACK TO SCENE

The Vanguard reaches out his right gauntlet. Grasps Jackson's hand gently but firmly.

THUD.

He shakes. Once. Twice. Up and down. Mechanical precision.

Then releases her hand. Unharmed.

He resumes his resting position. Arms on the table.

DUNCAN (V.O.)
(through earpiece)
Keep it casual.

Jackson sits down across from him. Opens her clipboard nervously.

Before she can speak—

VANGUARD
I want food. Now.

His voice is distorted through the helmet. Deep. Mechanical undertones. Unsettling.

Jackson smiles slightly. Pulls out two bottles of hard cinnamon whiskey from under the table.

JACKSON
I heard you like—

The Vanguard reaches across the table. Takes BOTH bottles from her hands before she can finish.

Opens one bottle. Twist cap. Efficient movement.

He reaches up to his helmet. Unhooks a HOSE that runs from his faceplate down to a port on his torso armor.

The hose hangs loose like an elephant's trunk.

He twists the open bottle. Shoves the bottle's opening directly into the trunk hose with practiced ease.

Tips the bottle back.

GULP. GULP. GULP.

Jackson watches. Disturbed by the sight.

JACKSON
Is that... healthy for you?

VANGUARD
No.

He finishes half the bottle before stopping.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
But it helps with the boredom.

JACKSON
So this is boring for you?

VANGUARD
Not anymore.

He attaches the bottle again. Finishes it completely.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
(setting down empty bottle)
So is this the part where you try to be my friend?

Jackson is thrown off balance. Not the direction she expected.

JACKSON
I beg your pardon?

VANGUARD
The last lady was old. Sixty. Gray hair. So they send in the cute one next?

DUNCAN (V.O.)
(through earpiece)
He's sizing you up. Talk back.

JACKSON
I was handpicked for this assignment.

The Vanguard picks up the second bottle. Opens it. Attaches it to his trunk hose without hesitation.

CHUG. CHUG. CHUG.

Finishes the entire bottle in one go. Sets it down hard.

VANGUARD
You were handpicked to die.

Silence. Heavy. Oppressive.

Jackson doesn't know how to respond to that direct statement.

JACKSON
Usually people get drunk before they make stupid threats.

She reaches under the table. Pulls out another bottle. Slides it toward him. Testing.

After a long moment, the tension defuses slightly. The Vanguard takes the bottle.

VANGUARD
If Director Duncan wants answers, he can come in here himself.

JACKSON
How do you know his name?

The Vanguard sighs. A mechanical sound through the helmet. Almost frustrated.

VANGUARD
We are done here.

He stands abruptly. No restraints stop him. He's completely free.

He points his wrist-gun directly at Jackson's face.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP - THE WRIST-GUN BARREL

We see inside the bullet chamber. The internal mechanics. The bullet loaded and ready.

BACK TO SCENE

Jackson stands quickly. Backs toward the door. Hands raised defensively.

JACKSON
Please don't—

The Vanguard follows her slowly. Gun still aimed at her head. Deliberate. Methodical.

Jackson reaches the door. Tries the handle desperately. Locked.

She turns back to him. Trapped.

JACKSON (CONT'D)
For the love of god, don't!

HELMET P.O.V.

Yellow box scanning Jackson again. Faster now. More aggressive.

Text flashing: "TARGET ACQUIRED"

BACK TO SCENE

The Vanguard squeezes his gauntlet to fire.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP - INSIDE THE GUN BARREL

The chamber loads. Gunpowder ignites.

The bullet moves forward—

Then STOPS mid-barrel. Impossibly.

Reverses direction. Moving backward into the chamber.

SOUND DESIGN: Gun click. Quantum whine (high-frequency dissonance). Bullet retreating unnaturally.

BACK TO SCENE

Nothing but dry air comes out of the barrel.

VANGUARD
What?

He tries again. CLICK. Nothing.

He tries a third time. CLICK. Still nothing.

HELMET P.O.V.

Yellow box flashing around Jackson frantically.

Text: "!!! CAUSALITY ERROR !!!"
"!!! CAUSALITY ERROR !!!"
"!!! CAUSALITY ERROR !!!"

BACK TO SCENE

The Vanguard is annoyed. Confused. This has never happened before.

He marches up to Jackson. THUD. THUD. THUD.

She's scared but doesn't turn away. Nowhere to go. Cornered.

He reaches out. Precisely grabs a lock of her hair. Pulls out a few strands with a sudden tug.

JACKSON
Ow!

The Vanguard steps back. Examines the hair strands in his gauntlet carefully.

HELMET P.O.V.

Yellow box scanning the hair. DNA HELIX appears on both sides of the screen. Rotating. Analyzing.

Genetic analysis running rapidly. Comparing sequences.

Text: "ANALYSIS COMPLETE"

"GENETIC MATCH: 99.97%"

"TEMPORAL PARADOX DETECTED"

BACK TO SCENE

The Vanguard discovers the terrible truth.

He lowers his hand slowly. Steps away from Jackson.

Walks to the one-way mirror purposefully.

Looks directly at it. As if he can see through to the other side.

HELMET P.O.V.

Black and white filter. Thermal imaging activated.

Scientists visible through the mirror as heat signatures. Yellow boxes identifying each person systematically.

In the middle of the stairs: DUNCAN, DIRECTOR - IDENTIFIED

BACK TO SCENE

VANGUARD
Director Duncan. You are playing dirty.

---

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Duncan stands in the middle of the stairs. Arms crossed. Big grin on his face. Satisfied.

DUNCAN
(to himself, quietly)
I got you, you son of a bitch.

He presses his earpiece.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Can you hear me, Jackson?

---

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jackson is still pressed against the door. Jiggling the handle uselessly.

JACKSON
(into earpiece, angry)
I can hear you, asshole.

DUNCAN (V.O.)
(through earpiece, amused)
I think we're done for the day.

The blast door suddenly opens with a HISS.

Jackson runs out immediately. Fast. Not looking back.

The Vanguard sits back down in his seat slowly. Contemplating what just happened.

---

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jackson runs past the blue floor panels. Up the stairs. Toward Duncan.

She gets right in his face. Furious.

SLAPS him. Hard.

Duncan's head snaps to the side. He recovers quickly. Still smiling. Almost pleased.

DUNCAN
I'm still your superior officer.

JACKSON
"You were handpicked to die." What did he MEAN by that?

DUNCAN
You're still breathing.

JACKSON
What?

DUNCAN
The janitor this morning? He wasn't mopping coffee.

Jackson looks toward where the janitor wheeled his bucket earlier. The blood bucket. Realization dawning.

JACKSON
How many?

Duncan doesn't answer. Just stares at her.

DUNCAN
But not you.

Silence. Heavy implication.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
He wanted to kill you. He always kills his interrogators. But he can't kill you.

He leans forward. Intense.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
And we are going to use that.

Jackson looks around frantically. Sees a trash can by one of the desks.

Walks over to it. Leans over it.

PUKES.

Still face over the trash can. She tries to regain composure. Breathing hard.

JACKSON
I get the disarm codes and I'm done?

Duncan nods once.

DUNCAN
Those are your only orders.

He pulls out his wallet. Removes all his cash. Hands it to Jackson.

She takes it. Confused by the gesture.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Take tomorrow off. We start Wednesday.

Jackson nods weakly. Walks up the stairs toward the exit on unsteady legs.

---

INT. LABORATORY 7 - NIGHT

TITLE CARD: "That Night - 2300 Hours"

A sterile lab. White walls. Centrifuges spinning with samples. Microscopes on every surface. Blood samples in refrigerated units glowing under UV light.

The door opens. Duncan enters. Wearing a lab coat over his uniform now.

A FEMALE SCIENTIST (40s, exhausted, dark circles under eyes) looks up from her microscope. Startled.

SCIENTIST
Sir, you shouldn't be here at—

DUNCAN
Show me.

She hesitates. Looks around nervously. They're alone.

She pulls up a microscope slide carefully. Gestures for him to look.

Duncan leans over the microscope.

MICROSCOPE VIEW - EXTREME CLOSE-UP

Blood cells. But they're WRONG. Fundamentally wrong.

Some are moving BACKWARDS through the plasma.

Some are FLICKERING in and out of existence like strobe lights.

Some are SPLITTING and then UNMERGING. Defying physics.

BACK TO SCENE

Duncan stares. Transfixed. Fascinated.

SCIENTIST
His blood doesn't obey causality. The cells exist in multiple temporal states simultaneously.

Duncan looks up from the microscope slowly.

DUNCAN
Can we synthesize it?

SCIENTIST
Sir, even if we could, the ethical implications—

DUNCAN
(interrupting sharply)
Can. We. Synthesize. It.

Pause. The scientist looks at his face. Something in his eyes terrifies her.

SCIENTIST
(quietly)
Theoretically. Yes.

Duncan reaches into his coat pocket. Pulls out a SYRINGE. Already prepared. He came ready.

DUNCAN
Take my blood.

SCIENTIST
Sir, I can't—

He GRABS her hand forcefully. Forces the syringe into it.

DUNCAN
That's an order.

She trembles. Looks at his face again. The intensity. The obsession.

Something in his eyes terrifies her deeply.

She swabs his arm with alcohol. Inserts the needle with shaking hands.

CLOSE-UP - THE SYRINGE

Duncan's blood filling it. Dark red. Too dark. Almost black. Unnaturally viscous.

She withdraws the needle carefully.

DUNCAN
How long until you can combine them?

SCIENTIST
I... I don't know. Weeks. Maybe months.

DUNCAN
You have three days.

He turns to leave. No further discussion.

SCIENTIST
Sir... what are you planning?

Duncan stops at the door. Doesn't turn around.

DUNCAN
Salvation.

He exits.

CLOSE-UP - THE SCIENTIST

Holding the syringe. Her hand is shaking uncontrollably.

She looks down at the blood samples. Duncan's blood next to the Vanguard's blood. Side by side.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

TITLE CARD: "Wednesday"

Jackson enters. More confident now. Professional demeanor. Two bottles of cinnamon whiskey on the table already.

The Vanguard sits in his chair. Arms folded. Waiting.

JACKSON
Let's try this again.

She sits down across from him. Slides one bottle toward him.

He takes it. Opens it. Drinks methodically.

JACKSON (CONT'D)
You're from the future. But you can't kill me because...?

The Vanguard finishes drinking. Sets the bottle down precisely.

Sighs. A mechanical sound through the helmet.

The Vanguard taps a control on his left gauntlet.

A HOLOGRAPHIC TIMELINE TREE appears on the table between them.

VISUAL EFFECT: Branching possibilities. Beautiful. Terrifying. Blue light illuminating their faces.

Hundreds of timelines splitting and merging. Complex. Fractal patterns.

The Vanguard's finger traces one branch where Jackson dies.

That branch DISSOLVES like smoke. And Vanguard's branch DISSOLVES with it simultaneously.

VANGUARD
Causality.

Jackson stares at the hologram. Understanding dawning slowly.

JACKSON
I'm... your anchor point.

The Vanguard closes his fist. The hologram disappears instantly.

He nods once. Confirmation.

JACKSON (CONT'D)
But someone else can kill me. Someone not from your timeline.

The Vanguard nods again.

VANGUARD
Like Duncan.

JACKSON
So these bombs you placed... what are they?

VANGUARD
Leverage.

JACKSON
For what?

VANGUARD
To force Duncan into this room. Alone.

JACKSON
Why?

VANGUARD
(stares at the space where hologram was)
I've watched it six times. Always the same.

JACKSON
Watched what?

VANGUARD
The end.
(beat)
It starts with him.

JACKSON
Duncan discovers time travel?

The Vanguard closes his fist where the hologram was.

VANGUARD
He uses it. World ends. Temporal collapse. My mission: kill him before he tampers with time.

Jackson leans back. Processing this impossible information.

JACKSON
Why not give us the disarm codes? Let us deal with Duncan.

VANGUARD
Because you won't. You'll protect him. He always escapes. I've seen it. Six different approaches. This timeline is the closest I've come.

JACKSON
What happens if you fail again?

He presses his gauntlet.

A HOLOGRAPHIC MAP projects onto the table.

The city. Dozens of red dots covering most of the city and surrounding areas.

Jackson stares at the map. Counting silently. Scribbling notes desperately.

JACKSON
(muttering, counting)
Twelve... fourteen... seventeen...

The Vanguard closes his palm. The image disappears.

VANGUARD
I want Director Duncan. In this room. Alone.

JACKSON
That won't happen.

VANGUARD
Then more people will die.

He turns away from her. Dismissive.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
We're done.

Jackson gathers her notes hurriedly. Stands. Heads for the door.

The door opens automatically.

She pauses at the threshold. Looks back.

JACKSON
For what it's worth... I believe you.

The Vanguard doesn't respond. Doesn't move.

Jackson leaves.

---

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

Jackson exits the interrogation room. Duncan is waiting at the bottom of the stairs. Arms crossed.

DUNCAN
Well?

JACKSON
He says you discover time travel and end the world.

Duncan laughs. Genuinely amused.

JACKSON (CONT'D)
He has seventeen bombs. Showed me a map.

Duncan stops laughing immediately.

DUNCAN
Did he give disarm codes?

JACKSON
No. He wants you. Alone.

Duncan paces. Thinking. Processing.

DUNCAN
Get me a full report. Every detail.

JACKSON
You're actually considering his story?

DUNCAN
I'm considering his technology.

He pulls out his wallet slowly. Opens it. Removes a PHOTO carefully.

A young woman. Duncan's eyes. His mother. Clearly.

His hand trembles slightly as he holds it.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
(quiet, not looking at Jackson)
She died when I was twelve. Preventable accident.

He stares at the photo for a long moment. Lost in memory.

Then puts it away. Stands straighter. Back to business.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Get me that report. Dismissed.

Jackson leaves quietly.

Duncan stares through the one-way mirror at the Vanguard. Still sitting motionless.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
(to himself, whisper)
I will save her.

EXT. BUSINESS SKYSCRAPER - NIGHT

The disk bomb in the lobby. Three rings glowing red ominously.

BEEP.

The outer ring disappears. Down to two rings.

BEEP.

Down to one ring.

The bomb emits a loud siren. Nuclear warning sound. Ear-splitting.

WUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAНАНАНАНАННΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗ

Sonic rings pulse outward from the bomb in visible waves.

People in the lobby cover their ears. Run for the exits in panic.

---

EXT. BUSINESS SKYSCRAPER - NIGHT

People pour out of the building. Fleeing in all directions.

Inside, the siren grows LOUDER. More insistent.

WUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAHAНАНАНАНΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗ

Then—

A BRIGHT BLUE FLASH.

The entire building is consumed by a blue mushroom cloud. Forty feet high. Expanding rapidly.

SLOW MOTION - INSIDE THE EXPLOSION

We see the electromagnetic waves shoot through concrete, steel, glass like water through tissue paper.

Electron-positron annihilation creating Cherenkov radiation (blue glow).

Windows SHATTER outward in beautiful, deadly patterns. Dust and debris explode in all directions.

People outside duck behind cars. Glass rains down like deadly rain.

BACK TO REAL TIME

The siren dies slowly.

Softer... softer... softer... gone.

The blue cloud dissipates into the night air.

The building stands—but HALF-COLLAPSED. The entire lobby is gone. Structural damage catastrophic.

---

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

Alarms BLARING throughout the base. Red lights FLASHING everywhere.

Scientists scrambling. Shouting. Chaos. Controlled panic.

Duncan stands in the middle of it all. Perfectly still. Staring at a monitor.

News footage of the explosion. Playing on loop. Over and over.

A scientist rushes over. Out of breath.

SCIENTIST
Sir! The device detonated at the skyscraper. Casualty reports coming in now.

DUNCAN
How many?

SCIENTIST
At least twenty dead. Hundreds injured.

Duncan clenches his fists. Jaw tight.

DUNCAN
Find Jackson. Accelerate interrogation schedule.

SCIENTIST
Yes, sir.

The scientist runs off.

Duncan stares at the monitor. The blue mushroom cloud replays. Again. Again. Again.

---

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 515 - DAY

A small, clean hospital room. Bed. TV. Bathroom. Sink. Window overlooking the city.

GRANDMA DUNCAN sits in her bed. Surrounded by flower arrangements. Purple bell flowers everywhere.

She's on the phone. Smiling warmly.

GRANDMA
How's my favorite grandson doing!

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. UNDERGROUND BASE - HALLWAY - DAY

Duncan leans against the concrete wall. Phone to his ear. Smiling genuinely.

DUNCAN
Hey, Grams. How are you doing?

GRANDMA
Oh, I just finished breakfast. And I'm staring at the most beautiful purple flowers.

DUNCAN
Those must be the bell flowers.

A HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER (maroon shirt, white scrubs) enters Grandma's room quietly. Takes her breakfast tray.

Grandma smiles and thanks her warmly.

GRANDMA
So what can I do for you today?

DUNCAN
Nothing, Grams. I just wanted to hear your voice.

GRANDMA
You're sweet. But I know you. What's on your mind?

Duncan hesitates. Choosing words carefully.

DUNCAN
I'm working on something... big. Life-changing technology.

GRANDMA
Another one of your projects?

DUNCAN
This one's different. If I succeed... we could fix everything. Every mistake. Every—

GRANDMA
(interrupting gently)
Every loss?

Silence on Duncan's end.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
David. You can't bring her back.

DUNCAN
(quietly)
I know.

GRANDMA
Your mother wouldn't want you chasing ghosts.

DUNCAN
I'm not chasing ghosts, Grams. I'm chasing the future.

GRANDMA
Promise me something. When you unlock these secrets... use them to help people. Not hurt them.

Duncan looks away from his reflection in the hallway window. Can't meet his own eyes.

DUNCAN
(lying)
I promise.

She smiles. Trusting him completely.

GRANDMA
Go be a hero, champ.

DUNCAN
I love you, Grams.

GRANDMA
I love you too, David.

Duncan hangs up. Stares at his phone for a long moment.

---

INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

The Hospital Staff Member pushes her cart toward the elevators.

She passes right by the DISK BOMB sitting in the middle of the lobby floor.

Three rings glowing red.

She doesn't notice it. Walks right past. Oblivious.

---

INT. UNDERGROUND BASE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Duncan pockets his phone. Heads back toward the observation room.

---

INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

BEEP.

The disk bomb drops to two rings.

---

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

Duncan enters. Scientists are monitoring data on multiple screens.

Everything seems normal. Routine.

Suddenly—ALARMS BLARE. RED LIGHTS FLASH.

A scientist turns to Duncan. Panicked. Face white.

SCIENTIST
Sir! Another device just activated!

DUNCAN
Where?!

SCIENTIST
Many Blessings Hospital. Fifth floor.

Duncan's face drains of all color. Complete shock.

DUNCAN
No. No no no no—

He pulls out his phone. Dials frantically. Fingers shaking.

SPLIT-SCREEN SEQUENCE (Wes Anderson style - perfectly symmetrical):

LEFT SCREEN: Duncan in underground bunker hallway
RIGHT SCREEN: Grandma in hospital bed

Both in REAL-TIME LONG TAKE. No cuts for 4 minutes.

RIGHT SCREEN:

Grandma's phone rings on her bedside table. She picks it up.

GRANDMA
David? You just called—

LEFT SCREEN:

DUNCAN
(panicked, breathless)
Grandma! Get out of the hospital RIGHT NOW!

RIGHT SCREEN:

GRANDMA
What? Why—

LEFT SCREEN:

DUNCAN
There's a bomb! Get out! NOW!

HOSPITAL LOBBY:

BEEP.

The disk bomb drops to one ring.

The bomb emits its nuclear siren.

WUUUUUUUUUUAAAAААААНАНАНАНАНННΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗ

RIGHT SCREEN:

Grandma hears the alarm through the phone and through her door.

Her eyes widen with terror.

GRANDMA
David, I hear it—

She tries to get out of bed. Her legs give out. She FALLS to the floor hard.

She struggles to stand. But she's too frail. Too slow. Too weak.

GRANDMA (CONT'D)
(into phone, terrified)
I can't... I can't get up—

LEFT SCREEN:

Duncan is RUNNING down the hall at full speed. Phone pressed to his ear.

DUNCAN
GRANDMA! STAY ON THE LINE!

He pulls out a second phone. Dials emergency services while running. Two phones.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
(into second phone)
I need EVAC on Many Blessings Hospital! Room 5-1-5! Debra Duncan! NOW!

VOICE (V.O.)
(through phone)
Sir, we have units—

DUNCAN
SEND THEM NOW!

RIGHT SCREEN:

A GOOD-HEARTED NURSE grabs a wheelchair from the hallway. Rushes toward room 515 at full speed.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 515 - DAY (RIGHT SCREEN)

The door bursts open. The Nurse rushes in.

NURSE
Ma'am, we have to go!

She lifts Grandma Duncan into the wheelchair with practiced efficiency.

GRANDMA
(still holding phone)
David—

LEFT SCREEN:

DUNCAN
(through phone)
I'm here, Grams! Just get to the elevator!

RIGHT SCREEN:

The Nurse pushes Grandma Duncan toward the door. Into the hallway. Moving fast.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY (RIGHT SCREEN)

Chaos. Panic. Other patients and staff rush past them in all directions.

The alarm blares louder. The walls vibrate with the sound.

WUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAАНАНАНАНАННΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗ

The Nurse pushes the wheelchair faster. Navigating through the chaos. Toward the elevator bank.

They're almost there—

LEFT SCREEN:

Duncan listens to the phone intensely. Still sprinting.

DUNCAN
Grandma?! Talk to me!

The alarm screams through the phone speaker.

WUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAHAНАНАНАНΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗ

Then—

A faint voice through the chaos. The Good-Hearted Nurse.

NURSE (V.O.)
(distant, through phone)
We're at the elevator! We're gonna make it!

Duncan's face floods with hope. Relief washing over him.

DUNCAN
YES! Get her out! GET HER OUT!

HOSPITAL LOBBY:

The disk bomb screams louder. Final countdown.

WUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAААНАНАНАНАНННННΗΗΗΗΗΗ

BOOM.

BLUE EXPLOSION.

Magnetic waves shoot upward from the lobby, consuming the entire building floor by floor.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY/ELEVATOR - DAY (RIGHT SCREEN)

The elevator doors slide open.

Grandma Duncan and the Nurse are about to enter—

The blue blast reaches the fifth floor from below. Unstoppable.

SLOW MOTION:

The electromagnetic wave hits them directly.

Their bodies are illuminated from within—bones visible like X-rays through flesh.

Flesh. Skeleton. Light.

Then consumed entirely. Disintegrated.

REAL TIME:

They're gone. Completely.

The entire RIGHT SCREEN is covered in blue light.

Then—

RIGHT SCREEN goes BLACK.

LEFT SCREEN - FULL SCREEN NOW:

Duncan listens to the phone. Frozen in place.

The alarm screams.

WUUUUUUUUUUAAAAААААНАНАНАНАНННΗΗΗΗΗΗΗΗ

Then—THUD.

Silence. Complete. Absolute.

The call drops.

ΒΕΕΡ. ΒΕΕΡ. ΒΕΕΡ.

Duncan stands frozen in the hallway. Staring at his phone.

He connects the dots slowly. Processing.

She was at the elevator.

She was ten seconds away.

But the bomb went off anyway.

She's dead.

Duncan's face twists. Grief. Rage. Devastation. All at once. Everything collapsing.

All sound MUTES. We only hear ringing in his ears. High-pitched. Endless.

CLOSE-UP - DUNCAN'S FACE

Tears stream down his face. His mouth open in a silent scream. No sound escapes.

He clenches his fist. Slams his phone against the concrete wall violently.

SMACK.

The screen cracks. Spider-web pattern.

SMACK.

SMACK.

He keeps going. Over and over. Until the phone is twisted metal and broken glass. Unrecognizable.

His right palm BLEEDS profusely. He doesn't notice the pain. Doesn't feel anything.

He breathes heavily. Pushes hair out of his face with his bloody hand. Blood smears across his forehead.

Pulls out his second phone with shaking hands. Dials. Voice eerily controlled now.

VOICE (V.O.)
Hello?

DUNCAN
(cold, controlled, dead inside)
Prepare surgical room 195. Full containment protocol.
(beat)
And bring me Jackson.

Pause on the other end.

VOICE (V.O.)
Understood, sir.

Duncan clicks off.

He slides down the wall slowly. Sits on the cold concrete floor.

Stares at his bleeding hand. Blood dripping onto the floor.

DUNCAN
(whisper)
I will break you.

SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

---

INT. JACKSON'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Red digital clock glowing: 1:33 AM

THUD. THUD. THUD on the door. Loud. Aggressive.

Jackson wakes. Disoriented. Confused.

BANG! The door flies open. Light floods in from the hallway.

Four military personnel swarm her small room. The Military Police Officer leads them. All armed.

Guns pointed directly at her.

OFFICER
Jackson. We need you to come with us.

He brandishes metal handcuffs. Official. No choice.

OFFICER (CONT'D)
Now.

Jackson is confused. Scared. Still half-asleep.

JACKSON
What's going on?

The officer doesn't answer. Grabs her arm roughly. Cuffs her wrists behind her back.

---

INT. UNDERGROUND BASE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jackson is escorted down the hall in handcuffs. Still in her sleepwear. Barefoot.

JACKSON
What's happening? Where are we going?

The Military Police Officer doesn't answer. Face blank. Following orders.

They reach a door marked: ROOM 195.

The officer presses buttons on a keypad. Turns a heavy latch. The pressurized door opens with a HISS.

They push her inside roughly.

---

INT. UNDERGROUND BASE - ROOM 195 - NIGHT

A large surgical room. Four spotlights point toward the center like an operating theater.

A white bed with leather restraints. Surgical instruments on a nearby table—including a saw and a jar of bright blue gel.

Blood stains the floor. Old stains. Many of them.

Jackson's eyes widen with terror.

Director Duncan stands in the shadows at the edge of the room. Arms crossed.

DUNCAN
Sit down, Jackson.

JACKSON
What is this?

DUNCAN
Sit. Down.

The guards force her into a chair roughly. Remove her handcuffs.

Duncan steps into the light slowly. His eyes are red from crying. He hasn't slept. Blood on his shirt cuff.

JACKSON
Sir, are you—

DUNCAN
Do you know what happened tonight?

JACKSON
Another bomb went off?

DUNCAN
My grandmother was in that hospital.

Silence. Heavy. Oppressive.

Jackson realizes. Her face falls. Sympathy mixed with fear.

JACKSON
I'm... I'm so sorry.

Duncan doesn't respond. He turns away from her.

Beat. Uncomfortable silence.

Jackson sees his shoulders shaking.

Is he... crying?

DUNCAN
(voice cracks)
Ten seconds.

Beat. He's not asking her anything. Just stating fact.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Do you know how long ten seconds is?

He's not asking her. He's asking the universe. Asking god. Asking anyone who will listen.

JACKSON
What happened?

DUNCAN
Everything.

He looks at her now. Eyes hollow. Dead inside.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
And nothing.

Silence. The weight of that statement.

JACKSON
What are you going to do?

Duncan looks at her. Eyes empty.

DUNCAN
I'm going to finish this.

JACKSON
How?

DUNCAN
By taking his suit.

JACKSON
You can't—

DUNCAN
You're coming with me. He won't hurt you.

Jackson stands. Backing away instinctively.

JACKSON
This is insane.

DUNCAN
This is survival.

He opens the door. The guards follow him out.

Jackson has no choice. She follows, trapped.

---

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

The Vanguard sits in his chair. Motionless. Asleep. Waiting.

VANGUARD
(snoring mechanically)
...ZZZZZZZZZ...

A loud THUD in the distance. Then another. Getting closer.

The Vanguard wakes instantly. Scans the room with his helmet.

He lifts his right gauntlet. Wrist-gun ready. Alert.

One moment passes. Two moments. Three moments.

Nothing happens.

VANGUARD
Just another mind game.

He shrugs. Taps the side of his helmet with one finger.

HELMET P.O.V.

Activates AUGMENTED REALITY OVERLAY (AR).

A pixelated race track appears in his vision. The Vanguard is in a virtual car. Retro video game. Techno music plays faintly.

BACK TO SCENE

The Vanguard "steers" with his gauntlets. Lost in his game. Passing time.

Suddenly—

The wall behind him begins to vibrate. Low frequency. Rising.

The entire back wall glows blue—the same gravity material from the blue floor panels.

The Vanguard doesn't notice. Too focused on his video game. Racing virtual cars.

The wall hums LOUDER. Glows brighter. Dark blue to bright blue. Intensifying.

The air fills with static electricity. Papers on the table start to lift slightly.

The Vanguard tries to "steer" his gauntlets in the game. They're sluggish. Heavy. Magnetic pull.

He tries to fight it when—

SUDDENLY:

The Vanguard, his chair, and his table fling backward against the wall at incredible speed.

CRASH.

The chair and table BREAK instantly as they slam into the wall with tremendous force.

The Vanguard is stuck against the wall like a fly in a trap. Arms spread in a T-pose. Can't move at all.

He grips his fists. Tries to break free with all his strength. Can't.

The one-way mirror SHATTERS explosively. Glass rains down like deadly rain.

Several red laser sight dots appear on the Vanguard's chest and head. Soldiers in the observation room. Ready to kill on command.

Silence. Tense. Waiting.

The interrogation room door opens slowly.

Director Duncan walks in deliberately. Wearing special boots—filled with wires, 20 pounds each. Magnetic compensation.

THUD. THUD. THUD.

He squares off with the Vanguard, who's still stuck helplessly on the wall.

Duncan walks two steps closer. Stops.

He brandishes a SHOCK STICK—a two-foot baton crackling with blue electricity. Dangerous.

DUNCAN
You... you!

He's seething. Barely controlled rage.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
You played dirty.

The Vanguard glares through his helmet. Silent. Defiant.

SHOCK!

Duncan jabs the stick into the Vanguard's armor viciously. Electricity surges through him. Painful.

The Vanguard convulses violently. But can't move away. Trapped.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
She almost made it! She was at the elevator!

SHOCK!

He stabs the stick near the neck gap brutally. Maximum pain.

The Vanguard jolts. Chest arching upward. Still stuck to the wall.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Ten seconds! That's all she needed!

SHOCK!

The Vanguard jolts again. Goes limp. Unconscious from the electrical assault.

Duncan stabs him one more time. Just to vent his anger. Pure rage.

SHOCK!

The Vanguard doesn't respond. Dead weight. Powered down.

Duncan regains composure slowly. Breathing hard. Sweating.

He raises his radio to his mouth.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Get me Gamma Squad.

He stares at his trophy on the wall. His prize.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
I want his armor off.

Beat. Decision made.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
And transport the subject to room 195.

He clicks off his radio. Walks closer to the unconscious Vanguard.

Slaps him across the helmet hard. The head moves sideways limply.

No response. Completely powered down. Unconscious.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
I've won.

CUT TO BLACK.

---

INT. UNDERGROUND BASE - ROOM 195 - NIGHT

Jackson sits in the corner, guarded by two armed soldiers. Hands folded. Terrified.

The door opens.

More soldiers drag in the NAKED MAN—the Vanguard without his armor.

Unconscious. Six feet tall. Muscular but sickly pale. Deep cuts and scars where armor was fused to his body. No hair. Pale skin covered in surgical marks.

They strap him to the white bed roughly. Restraints on his arms and legs. Tight.

Director Duncan enters, pushing a mobile dolly carrying pieces of the Vanguard's armor.

Jackson stares in horror.

JACKSON
What are you doing?

Duncan ignores her completely. He examines the armor pieces laid out on a surgical table methodically.

Boots. Leg plates. Chest plate. Gauntlets. Helmet.

He picks up the chest plate. Studying it.

DUNCAN
Fascinating. Quantum-locked joints. Neural interface here...

He traces a wire with his finger.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
...connected to biometric sensors.

JACKSON
You can't seriously be thinking—

DUNCAN
Thinking what, Jackson? That I'll put it on?

He smiles. Not kindly.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Of course I am.

JACKSON
You don't know how it works!

DUNCAN
Then I'll learn.

He begins putting on the boots.

Four military personnel step forward. Assist him, fastening the armor pieces to Duncan's body carefully.

Boots. Leg plates. Chest plate. Gauntlets. Shoulder plates.

SOUND DESIGN: Each piece CLICKS into place. But it sounds WRONG. Like bones breaking. Like metal grinding against flesh.

Duncan walks a few steps. THUD. THUD. THUD.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Heavier than I expected.

The armor doesn't fit him perfectly. Obvious gaps near his neck, arms, and belt. Not designed for his body.

Duncan lifts his left gauntlet. Squeezes his hand experimentally.

CLOSE-UP - INSIDE THE GAUNTLET

Neural interface tendrils SEARCH frantically for connection points.

They find his wrist. PIERCE his skin like needles.

BACK TO SCENE

Duncan GASPS. Pain. Sharp. Intense. But he doesn't remove it. Grits his teeth.

He turns off the safety for his wrist-gun. Testing.

The gun whizzes—a sonic hissing noise. It's armed. Live.

He lets go. The wrist-gun powers down.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
So this is how it feels.

He walks over to the Naked Man slowly.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
Tell me. How does the time travel work?

The Naked Man doesn't respond. Still unconscious. Head lolling.

Duncan points his wrist-gun at the Naked Man's face. Inches from his head. Point-blank range.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
I don't need you to maintain causality.

He removes the barrel slightly.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
So tell me how it works. Before I figure it out myself.

Jackson tries to interject desperately.

JACKSON
What about the bombs, sir?!

Duncan sighs. Annoyed at the interruption.

DUNCAN
This is more important.

JACKSON
Civilians are more important than your dead grandma!

Duncan is furious. He walks over to Jackson rapidly. THUD. THUD. THUD.

He stands over her. Towering. Intimidating in the armor.

She cowers in her chair.

DUNCAN
If I didn't need you, I would write your death off as an accident.

Beat. He leans closer.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
You think this is about my grandma?! This is about changing the world.

Beat.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
With time travel, Jackson, we can save many more lives than are lost today.

He shakes his head dismissively.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
I'm done with your stupidity.

Duncan grabs the Vanguard's helmet from the table. Places it on his head carefully.

There's still an obvious hole in the armor near the neck—the suit doesn't fit him properly. Vulnerable gap.

Duncan walks back to the Naked Man.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
I'm going to ask one last time. How does the suit work?

The Naked Man's eyes flutter open weakly. Gasps.

NAKED MAN
(weak, barely audible)
Just turn the knobs.

Duncan turns the knobs on his arms experimentally.

HELMET P.O.V.

Red filter covers the Naked Man. As Duncan turns the knobs, various menus pop open in his vision.

Duncan scrolls through the menus clumsily. Learning.

Text: "WEAPONS SYSTEM" "NAVIGATION" "TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT"

BACK TO SCENE

SUDDENLY his right wrist-gun goes off accidentally.

BANG-BANG-BANG.

Duncan recoils at the power. Surprised.

Then turns deliberately toward Jackson and the five armed military personnel in the room.

Duncan unleashes a flurry of bullets, sweeping his arm left to right. Testing. Killing.

BANG-BANG-BANG.

The military personnel drop. Dead. Blood spraying.

He sweeps again toward Jackson specifically.

BANG-BANG-BANG.

Jackson is still unharmed. All bullets went around her impossibly. Curved trajectories.

He sweeps again. Frustrated.

BANG-BANG-BANG.

Still alive. All bullets miss her. Physics defying.

HELMET P.O.V.

Red filter. Yellow box surrounds Jackson frantically.

"!!! CAUSALITY ERROR !!!"
"!!! CAUSALITY ERROR !!!"
"!!! CAUSALITY ERROR !!!"

BACK TO SCENE

Duncan admires his wrist-gun. Impressed despite the failure.

DUNCAN
What precise firepower.

He presses a knob on his chest. Exploring the interface.

HELMET P.O.V.

Scrolls through menus rapidly. Reaches the TIME TRAVEL OPTION.

BACK TO SCENE

DUNCAN
There we go.

He begins turning the dial on the armor's chest slowly. Carefully.

HELMET P.O.V.

Various dates scroll by rapidly: 2025... 2024... 2023... 2022...

Going backwards in time. Further and further.

Stops on: "December 25, 1995"

The year his mother died.

BACK TO SCENE

DUNCAN
There we go.

He slaps the center dial. Confirmation. His armor begins to glow blue.

The air fills with static electricity. Papers swirl. Energy building.

The Naked Man lifts his head from the table with great effort. Looks directly at Jackson.

They lock eyes. Understanding passes between them.

NAKED MAN
This is how it happens.

Jackson realizes what she has to do.

She looks at Duncan. Then at a dead guard's gun on the floor near her feet.

Then back at Duncan—who's about to time travel. About to change everything.

She has seconds to decide. Maybe less.

Jackson's mind races.

EXTREME CLOSE-UP - HER EYES

Pupils dilate. Decision forming.

TIME SLOWS TO 10%.

VISUAL INSERT #1 (3 frames):

Grandma Duncan smiling warmly in the hospital photo.

BACK TO JACKSON.

VISUAL INSERT #2 (3 frames):

The skyscraper exploding. Bodies falling. Blue light. Death.

BACK TO JACKSON.

VISUAL INSERT #3 (3 frames):

Vanguard's hologram. Timeline tree collapsing. Reality unraveling.

BACK TO JACKSON.

VISUAL INSERT #4 (3 frames):

Drill Sergeant's face: "You don't get to wiggle out of duty by being incompetent."

BACK TO JACKSON.

VISUAL INSERT #5 (3 frames):

Duncan's face, crying, blood-smeared: "Ten seconds away."

BACK TO JACKSON.

Her face hardens. Decision made.

REAL-TIME RESUMES.

She DIVES for the gun on the floor.

SLOW MOTION (50%):

Her fingers close around the grip.

She ROLLS across the floor. Comes up on one knee. Firing stance.

Aims at Duncan's neck. The gap in the armor.

Duncan sees her. His eyes widen behind the visor. Realizes.

HELMET P.O.V.

Yellow box appears around Jackson.

"!!! CAUSALITY ERROR !!!"
"!!! CAUSALITY ERROR !!!"

His finger tries to squeeze the trigger. Fight back.

The servos LOCK. He can't fire at her. Physically impossible.

BACK TO SCENE

Jackson fires without hesitation.

HYPER SLOW MOTION (5%):

Muzzle flash. Bright. Blinding.

Bullet leaves barrel.

The bullet travels through air. We see its rotation. Every detail. The rifling marks.

Crosses 15 feet in 3 seconds of screen time.

Duncan tries to move. Tries to dodge. Too slow. Too late.

The bullet enters his NECK—the gap in armor. The vulnerable spot.

MACRO SHOT - Bullet penetrates flesh. Blood spray backlit by the armor's blue glow. Beautiful. Terrible.

Duncan's hands fly to his neck instinctively.

REAL-TIME:

He stumbles backward. Falls to his knees. Heavy.

Blood pours through his fingers. Dark. Arterial.

He looks at Jackson. Eyes visible through the visor. Confusion. Betrayal. Sadness.

DUNCAN
(gurgling, through helmet speaker)
Mom... I almost...

His eyes glaze. Seeing something only he can see. Another place. Another time.

DUNCAN (CONT'D)
(whisper, childlike)
I'm sorry.

Then nothing. Eyes empty.

He collapses forward. THUD.

The armor stops glowing immediately. Static dies. Energy dissipates.

SILENCE.

Complete. Absolute. Oppressive.

Jackson drops the gun. It clatters on the floor.

Her hands shake violently. Uncontrollably.

She stares at Duncan's body. Can't look away.

CLOSE-UP - BLOOD POOLING

Beneath him. Spreading slowly. Reaching toward her feet like fingers.

She steps back instinctively.

Her stomach turns. Bile rising.

She leans over. PUKES.

(THIRD TIME - FULL CIRCLE)

Vomit splashes on the floor. Just like in boot camp. Just like in the observation room. Full circle complete.

The Naked Man watches from the table. Weak but conscious.

NAKED MAN
(whisper)
Thank you.

JACKSON
(barely audible)
Was there ever another way?

The Naked Man closes his eyes. Doesn't answer immediately.

JACKSON (CONT'D)
(to herself, mechanical)
I had to. I had to. I had to.

She's trying to convince herself. Repeating it like a mantra.

NAKED MAN
(quietly)
You did.

Jackson finally looks at him. Tears streaming.

JACKSON
(voice breaking)
Then why doesn't it feel like that?

The Naked Man has no answer. Neither does she.

Silence. Heavy. Crushing.

Red alarm suddenly rings. WONK. WONK. WONK.

The room flashes red and black. Emergency lighting.

Several more guards rush in. Over twenty personnel flood the room. Weapons drawn.

They aim their guns at Jackson and the Naked Man.

OFFICER
DO NOT MOVE A MUSCLE!

Jackson raises her hands slowly. Shaking. Covered in vomit and tears.

Guards surround her. Grab her arms roughly. Force her to the ground face-first.

She doesn't resist. Doesn't fight. Empty.

She stares at Duncan's body from the floor.

Blood pooling. Still spreading.

Jackson's stomach turns again.

She leans to the side. Pukes again. Nothing left but bile.

The vomit splashes on the floor.

Just like in boot camp. Where this all started.

Full circle. Complete.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. COURT ROOM - DAY

TITLE CARD: "Three Weeks Later"

Five JUDGES in brown uniforms sit in the judge's box. Well-decorated for past valor. Medals. Ribbons. Authority.

JUDGE 3 (senior, stern, 60s) reads case notes carefully.

JUDGE 3
What is the next case?

JUDGE 1 reads off the notes from a file.

JUDGE 1
Recruit Jackson, sir.

JUDGE 3
She doesn't have a rank?

JUDGE 1
She never made it out of boot camp.

Judge 3 shakes his head. Disapproving.

JUDGE 3
Send her in.

The BAILIFF opens the double doors.

Jackson enters with two guards flanking her. Her LAWYER (blue military suit, 40s, tired) walks beside her.

She sits at the defendant's table.

She looks thinner. Exhausted. Haunted. Dark circles under her eyes. Hair pulled back severely.

She nudges her Lawyer's shoulder quietly.

JACKSON
When do I get to speak?

LAWYER
This isn't a trial. It's a court-martial.

The Judges review paperwork. Conferring quietly.

Judge 3 sighs. Folds his papers together. Decision made.

JUDGE 3
Would the defendant please stand at the podium.

Jackson stands. All eyes on her. Judgment.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
Recruit Jackson. You were tasked with a two-year service to your country.

Silence. Letting that sink in.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
Most candidates simply pass their training and serve without incident.

Beat.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
And then we have you.

He reviews her file one more time.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
You were taken under the leadership of Director Duncan. To which you shot and killed him.

Jackson tries to interject. Desperate.

JACKSON
I can explain—

JUDGE 3
(interrupting firmly)
I don't care for your explanation, Recruit Jackson.

Beat. She shrinks back.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
So now we must assess the facts and figure out what to do with you.

He picks up a document. Official. Government seal.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
You were assigned to this case. Your order was to retrieve disarm codes from the Vanguard.

Beat.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
And it would seem you followed your orders precisely.

Jackson is confused. Not what she expected.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
Director Duncan, however, seemed to have forgotten his orders. He instead wanted to travel through time himself.

He looks at her directly.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
A dangerous and unauthorized action. A violation of the Temporal Weapons Treaty of 2018.

Jackson's eyes widen. (She didn't know there WAS a treaty.)

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
Furthermore, his actions directly led to civilian casualties.

Beat.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
And your actions prevented a potentially catastrophic temporal incursion.

He pauses. Lets that sink in.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
So with the facts presented today, we are ready for a vote.

He bangs his gavel once. THUD. Silence.

He motions to Judge 1.

JUDGE 1 bangs gavel. THUD.

JUDGE 1
On counts of murder in the second degree, insubordination, and failure to duty, I find the defendant...
Not guilty.

JUDGE 2 bangs her gavel. THUD.

JUDGE 2
Not guilty.

Jackson doesn't believe what she's hearing. Tears forming.

JUDGE 4 bangs his gavel. THUD.

JUDGE 4
Not guilty.

JUDGE 5 bangs his gavel. THUD.

JUDGE 5
Not guilty.

Judge 3 looks left and right. Final decision. Bangs his gavel. THUD.

JUDGE 3
Not guilty.

The gavel echoes in the silent courtroom.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
However, Recruit Jackson...

Jackson looks up. Waiting.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
You will undergo mandatory psychological evaluation. Six months minimum.

Her face falls. Six months.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
You took a life. Even if justified, that leaves scars.

He softens slightly. Almost fatherly.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
We want to help you carry them.

Pause. Heavy.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
Dismissed.

Jackson turns to leave. Legs unsteady.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
(calls out)
Miss Jackson.

She stops. Turns back.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
(quietly, kindly)
For what it's worth...

Beat.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
You did the right thing.

Jackson's eyes water. She nods once. Can't speak.

She exits quickly.

---

INT. COURT ROOM HALLWAY - DAY

Jackson stands alone in the empty hallway.

She looks at her hands. Still trembling. Always trembling now.

She closes her fists. Takes a breath.

Judge 3 exits the courtroom. Approaches her.

JUDGE 3
Approach the bench.

Jackson approaches cautiously.

Judge 3 speaks softly. Off the record now.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
After you... removed Director Duncan from leadership, your friend was suddenly willing to talk.

JACKSON
He's alive?

JUDGE 3
Yes. And his bombs will no longer be a problem.

Jackson is relieved. First good news in weeks.

JACKSON
So what happens to me now?

JUDGE 3
You've finished your draft. Your duty is complete. You can go.

Beat. Freedom. Strange concept now.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
But you know, with a few years of studying and hard work, you could become a director yourself.

Jackson shakes her head immediately.

JACKSON
I think I'm ready to retire.

Judge 3 smiles. Understanding.

But then his expression becomes serious. Something he needs to know.

JUDGE 3
Miss Jackson. Can I ask you something? Off the record.

She nods. Permission granted.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
When you pulled that trigger... did you believe Duncan was about to kill you? Was it self-defense?

Jackson hesitates. Long pause. Choosing truth over comfort.

Silence.

JACKSON
(quietly, honest)
No.

JUDGE 3
Then why did you do it?

Jackson looks away. Can't meet his eyes.

JACKSON
Because someone had to.

Judge 3 studies her for a long moment. Recognizing something.

JUDGE 3
That's what I thought.

Beat.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
The official record will say self-defense. But you and I both know the truth.

He leans back against the wall.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
You made a choice, Miss Jackson. A hard choice. And you'll have to live with it.

Beat.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
Can you?

Jackson looks at him directly now.

JACKSON
I don't know.

JUDGE 3
Well. You're free to find out.

He bangs his gavel one final time. THUD.

JUDGE 3 (CONT'D)
Dismissed.

Jackson turns and walks toward the exit slowly.

INT. UNDERGROUND BASE - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

TITLE CARD: "48 Hours After Court Martial"

The Vanguard—fully armored again—sits in his chair.

The door opens. The NEW INTERROGATOR (same man from earlier scenes) enters with bottles.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Hey, Vick. How you doing today?

The Vanguard taps his helmet. His video game turns off.

The New Interrogator shows two bottles of hard alcohol.

NEW INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
Which one do you want today?

VANGUARD
Cinnamon whiskey.

The New Interrogator hands him the bottle.

The Vanguard gingerly tries to open it. Struggles. Hands weak.

The New Interrogator opens it for him kindly. Gives it back.

The Vanguard attaches the bottle to his trunk hose. CHUG. CHUG. CHUG.

The New Interrogator opens his pen and paper. Routine questions.

NEW INTERROGATOR
So, Vick. Why did you suddenly become cooperative after Duncan's death?

The Vanguard is silent. Still drinking slowly.

NEW INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
We just want to make sure your answer is the same as before.

The Vanguard finishes the bottle. Sets it down.

VANGUARD
The timeline has been altered.

The New Interrogator writes notes.

NEW INTERROGATOR
And what can you tell me about your timeline?

VANGUARD
We don't have any beer.

The New Interrogator smiles. Writes it down. Humanity in the moment.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Seriously, though. Your cooperation has been... unexpected. What changed?

The Vanguard leans back in his chair.

VANGUARD
Duncan is dead. The threat is neutralized.

NEW INTERROGATOR
But he didn't time travel yet. Doesn't that mean your future still exists? Unchanged?

The Vanguard is silent for a long moment. Considering.

VANGUARD
Time is fluid. A river, not a road.

Beat.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
Duncan died before he could discover time travel. Before he could create the technology that would one day destroy my world.

Beat.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
So yes. My timeline... stabilizes.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Meaning?

VANGUARD
Meaning the catastrophe never happens. Billions are saved.

Beat. Quieter now.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
And I cease to exist.

The New Interrogator stops writing. Shocked.

NEW INTERROGATOR
You'll cease to exist?

VANGUARD
Eventually. The paradox will resolve itself. I'll fade. Like I was never born.

NEW INTERROGATOR
And you're... okay with that?

The Vanguard looks at the one-way mirror. As if he can see through it to something beyond.

VANGUARD
I completed my mission. That's all that matters.

Silence. Heavy. Meaningful.

The New Interrogator closes his notebook slowly.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Well. For what it's worth... thank you.

The Vanguard doesn't respond. Just sits.

The New Interrogator stands. Heads for the door.

NEW INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
Same time tomorrow?

The Vanguard pauses. Then speaks quietly.

VANGUARD
I never started.

The New Interrogator turns back, confused.

NEW INTERROGATOR
What?

VANGUARD
I never started. And soon, I'll have never finished. A soldier from a war that never happened.

Beat.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
Tell Jackson... she made the right choice.

The New Interrogator nods slowly. Understanding.

NEW INTERROGATOR
I will.

He leaves.

The Vanguard sits alone in the empty room.

He taps his helmet. His video game turns on. Techno music plays faintly.

He begins to "steer" his gauntlets. Lost in his game one last time.

Waiting to fade. Waiting to disappear. Waiting to have never existed.

---

INT. UNDERGROUND BASE - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

TITLE CARD: "72 Hours After Duncan's Death"

The Vanguard sits alone. Playing his video game. Techno music.

Suddenly, his helmet flickers. Glitches.

The game glitches. Pixelated errors.

He stops "steering." Looks at his gauntlet.

He presses a button on his gauntlet. A diagnostic screen appears.

HELMET P.O.V.

"WARNING: TEMPORAL INTEGRITY COMPROMISED"
"ESTIMATED TIME TO PARADOX RESOLUTION: 00:47:33"

BACK TO SCENE

The Vanguard stares at the message. Knowing what it means.

He closes the screen.

The New Interrogator enters with bottles.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Hey, Vick.

Vanguard's helmet flickers again. Game glitches more.

VANGUARD
(distorted voice)
Define... okay.

New Interrogator sets down the bottles.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Duncan's dead. You won.

VANGUARD
Did I?

He removes his helmet for the first time.

REVEAL - HIS FACE

Pale. Scarred. But HUMAN. Recognizable.

In his 30s. Tired eyes. Duncan's eyes. The family resemblance unmistakable.

NEW INTERROGATOR
(horrified, realizing)
You look like—

VANGUARD
I know.

He looks at his hands slowly.

They're TRANSPARENT at the fingertips. Fading. Disappearing.

NEW INTERROGATOR
You're... disappearing.

VANGUARD
(calm, accepting)
Paradox resolution. I was born into a timeline that no longer exists.

He puts his helmet back on slowly.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
So I'm being... unborn.

NEW INTERROGATOR
How long?

Vanguard taps his gauntlet. A countdown appears in the air:

"ESTIMATED TIME: 00:47:33"

NEW INTERROGATOR
Forty-seven minutes?

VANGUARD
Give or take.

Pause. Heavy silence.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Is there anything I can do?

Vanguard picks up a bottle. Opens it with difficulty.

VANGUARD
Stay with me.

CUT TO:

---

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

They're both drinking. Several empty bottles scattered.

Vanguard's transparency has spread to his wrists. More visible now.

NEW INTERROGATOR
(drunk, honest)
So what was your timeline like?

VANGUARD
Hot. The sun was dying.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Jesus.

VANGUARD
No beer. That was the worst part.

They laugh. Genuine. Human moment.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
But we had the priests. And their technology.

NEW INTERROGATOR
The time travel.

VANGUARD
(nods)
Duncan discovered it. Used it. Broke causality.

Pause.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
But you stopped him.

He corrects himself.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
She stopped him.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Jackson.

VANGUARD
Tell her... she made the right choice.

NEW INTERROGATOR
I will.

COUNTDOWN: 00:05:00

His arms are transparent to the elbows now. Fading faster.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Does it hurt?

VANGUARD
(looks at transparent hands)
You know what's funny?

NEW INTERROGATOR
What?

VANGUARD
I spent my whole life fighting to exist. And now... I finally get to stop.

He almost sounds relieved. At peace.

He taps his helmet. Video game turns on one last time.

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
One last race.

He begins to "steer" his gauntlets. Playing.

The New Interrogator watches. Witnessing.

00:01:00

Vanguard's entire torso is transparent now.

Only his head and helmet remain solid. Visible.

00:00:30

NEW INTERROGATOR
(whisper)
What's your real name?

Vanguard pauses the game. Final question.

VANGUARD
Victor.

NEW INTERROGATOR
Victor what?

00:00:10

VANGUARD
Duncan.

The New Interrogator freezes. The truth revealed.

NEW INTERROGATOR
What?

00:00:05

VANGUARD
(smiles sadly)
Director Duncan's grandson. From a future that never happens now.

00:00:03

The Interrogator's eyes widen. Full comprehension.

00:00:02

VANGUARD (CONT'D)
(whisper)
I never started.

00:00:01

His helmet flickers one last time.

00:00:00

GONE.

Completely. Instantly. As if he never existed.

The chair is empty.

Only a half-empty bottle remains. Evidence he was ever there.

The New Interrogator sits in silence. Alone now.

Then picks up his radio slowly.

NEW INTERROGATOR
(into radio, voice shaking)
Subject Victor Duncan has...

Pause. How to explain this?

NEW INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
...left the facility.

He sets down the radio carefully.

Picks up the bottle. Takes a long drink.

NEW INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
(to empty chair, quietly)
Godspeed, Victor.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

TITLE CARD: "Six Months Later"

Jackson walks down a busy city street. Civilian clothes. Jeans. T-shirt. Backpack over her shoulder.

She blends into the crowd. Just another person. Invisible.

Normal life. Or attempting it.

She stops at a street corner. Waits for the light to change.

A NEWS BROADCAST plays on a nearby screen mounted to a building.

NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)
In breaking news, the mysterious explosions that rocked the city last year have been officially attributed to an underground gas leak. Authorities say the situation is now under control...

Jackson watches the screen. Expressionless. She knows the truth.

The light changes to WALK.

She crosses the street with the crowd.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Jackson walks through the crowded street.

People everywhere. Laughing. Talking on phones. Living their lives.

She stops suddenly.

Looks around slowly.

Everyone is going about their lives. Normal. Unaware. Safe.

They have no idea how close they came to annihilation.

They have no idea what she did.

What she sacrificed.

Jackson takes a deep breath. In through nose. Out through mouth.

Suddenly, she feels... something.

A strange sensation. Like a weight lifting from her shoulders.

Like something releasing.

She looks around. Nothing has changed visibly.

But something feels different. Lighter.

She can't explain it.

She stands straighter. Shoulders back.

A woman bumps into her accidentally.

WOMAN
Oh! Sorry!

JACKSON
(small smile)
It's okay.

The woman smiles back and continues on.

Jackson watches her go. Living. Free.

Jackson keeps walking.

Forward.

Not backward. Not dwelling.

Forward.

Into the future.

A future that almost wasn't.

A future she saved.

SLOW FADE TO BLACK.

BLACK SCREEN

TITLE CARD:

"72 hours after the death of Director Duncan, the Vanguard's cell was found empty. No trace of him was ever discovered. The official report listed him as 'escaped.' But those who knew the truth understood: he had simply ceased to exist. A soldier from a future that would never come. A ghost, fading into paradox. And the only person who remembered him... was the woman who saved the world by ending his."

FADE OUT.

FINAL TITLE CARD:

THE END

FADE TO BLACK.
