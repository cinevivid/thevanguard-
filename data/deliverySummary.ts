## 💡 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Option A: Complete Remaining Hero Sequences ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
**Why:** These 9 sequences represent 60% of your film's impact
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to detail all hero sequences
**Deliverables:** 150+ pages of shot-by-shot breakdowns
**Value:** Complete technical roadmap for hardest production challenges

### Option B: Continue Act Two Scene-by-Scene
**Why:** Methodical, comprehensive coverage
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks for full Act Two + Three
**Deliverables:** 250+ pages covering all 56 remaining scenes
**Value:** Complete coverage, but slower to reach critical sequences

### Option C: Templates + Hero Sequences Hybrid
**Why:** Balance speed and detail
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks
**Deliverables:** 
- 9 hero sequences (full detail, 150 pages)
- 40 template variations (20 pages)
- Scene-specific examples (30 pages)
**Value:** Best efficiency, focus resources on high-impact work

### My Professional Recommendation:
**Go with Option A or C.**

**Reasoning:**
1. Hero sequences are make-or-break for AI generation (most complex)
2. Template scenes follow predictable patterns (you can customize)
3. Your time is better spent on sequences that require detailed planning
4. Festival submissions need showreel clips = hero sequences
5. Production budget (time/AI credits) should prioritize high-impact shots
