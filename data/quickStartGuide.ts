## 🎯 SHOT NAMING CONVENTION

Use this format for every file:

\`\`\`
ACT[#]_SCENE[###]_SHOT[LETTER]_[DESCRIPTOR]_[STATUS].png

Examples:
ACT1_SCENE001_SHOTA_Aerial_Sand_Circle_APPROVED.png
ACT1_SCENE001_SHOTB_Three_Priests_VARIATION_02.png
ACT2_SCENE020_SHOTA_Jackson_Interrogates_APPROVED.png
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:**
- Easy to find shots later
- Organized by act/scene
- Status tracking (VARIATION vs APPROVED)
- Professional workflow

---

## 📊 SHOT TRACKER SPREADSHEET

Create a Google Sheet or Excel file with these columns:

| Act | Scene | Shot | Description | Status | Attempts | Notes | Date Approved |
|-----|-------|------|-------------|--------|----------|-------|---------------|
| 1 | 001 | A | Aerial Sand Circle | ✅ Approved | 3 | Perfect on 3rd try | 2025-10-22 |
| 1 | 001 | B | Three Priests | 🔄 In Progress | 2 | Need better lighting | - |
| 1 | 001 | C | Green Priest Face | ⏳ Not Started | 0 | - | - |

**Status Legend:**
- ✅ Approved (ready for video generation)
- 🔄 In Progress (generating variations)
- ⏳ Not Started (not yet attempted)
- 🔁 Needs Revision (didn't meet quality standard)

**Track your progress:** Update this daily to see how close you are to completion.

## 🚫 AVOID THESE COMMON MISTAKES

### **Mistake 1: Perfectionism (The Dream Killer)**
❌ Don't regenerate 50 times trying to get the "perfect" image  
✅ Do: If it's 95% right after 5 attempts, approve it and move on

**Why:** You have 430 shots to generate. Perfectionism = never finishing.

---

### **Mistake 2: Ignoring Character Consistency**
❌ Don't skip the --cref parameter to "save time"  
✅ Do: ALWAYS use character canonical references for every shot

**Why:** Inconsistent characters = unprofessional, breaks immersion.

---

### **Mistake 3: Disorganized Files**
❌ Don't save everything in one folder with random names  
✅ Do: Follow the organized folder structure from Day 1

**Why:** Chaos at image generation = nightmare at editing stage.

---

### **Mistake 4: Starting with Hard Shots**
❌ Don't begin with Hero Sequence 1 (split-screen, hardest sequence)  
✅ Do: Start with Scene 001 (simpler, builds confidence)

**Why:** Early failure = discouragement = quitting.

---

### **Mistake 5: Working Alone Without Feedback**
❌ Don't hide your work until it's "perfect"  
✅ Do: Share progress shots on social media, get feedback

**Why:** Community support = motivation = completion.

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS FROM EXPERIENCED AI FILMMAKERS

### **Tip 1: Batch Similar Shots**
Generate all "close-ups of Jackson" in one session. Character consistency is easier when generating similar shots consecutively.

### **Tip 2: Use Style References**
Add \`--sref [URL]\` parameter in Midjourney for consistent visual style across all shots. Find a cinematic image you love, use it as style reference.

### **Tip 3: Generate Variations Before Choosing**
Don't just generate one image. Generate 4-5 variations, THEN pick the best. Options = better results.

### **Tip 4: Save Rejected Attempts**
Sometimes a "rejected" image works better for a different shot. Keep variations organized.

### **Tip 5: Take Breaks**
Don't burn out. 2-3 hours per day is sustainable. 8 hours = burnout = quitting.

## 🎥 WHEN TO MOVE TO VIDEO GENERATION

**Don't wait until ALL images are done.**

**Start video generation when:**
- You have 20-30 approved images
- You understand image generation workflow
- You're confident in consistency approach

**Why parallel workflow matters:**
- Image generation: 16 weeks if sequential
- Video generation: Can start at Week 4
- Parallel: Finish both by Week 18 (vs Week 32 sequential)

## 🏆 MOTIVATION: WHY YOU CAN DO THIS

### **You Have Advantages Most Filmmakers Don't:**

**1. Complete Pre-Production**
- Most indie filmmakers "figure it out as they go"
- You have 250+ pages of planning done
- Every shot has a detailed prompt ready

**2. Technology Advantage**
- AI generation in 2025 is 10x better than 2023
- Tools are mature, consistent, affordable
- Professional results possible for $500-1000

**3. Proven Workflow**
- Templates tested and working
- Examples show exactly what to do
- No guesswork remaining

**4. Achievable Scope**
- 430 shots is manageable (Hollywood films: 1,500-2,000)
- 90-minute runtime is perfect for festivals
- 7-month timeline is realistic

**5. Festival Timing**
- AI films in 2025-2026 = perfect timing
- You're early to the wave (not late)
- Professional execution distinguishes you from experiments

---

### **Reality Check: The Numbers**

**AI Filmmakers Who Start:** 10,000+  
**AI Filmmakers Who Plan Properly:** ~500  
**AI Filmmakers Who Complete Films:** ~50  
**AI Filmmakers at Major Festivals:** ~5-10

**You're already in the top 5% because of your planning.**

**Finishing puts you in the top 0.5%.**

---

## ⏰ TIME COMMITMENT - BE REALISTIC

### **Phase 1: Image Generation (Weeks 1-16)**
**Time Required:** 2-3 hours per day, 5-6 days per week
**Total:** 160-288 hours over 16 weeks
**This is your primary focus for the next 4 months**

### **Phase 2: Video Generation (Weeks 6-18)**
**Time Required:** 1-2 hours per day (parallel with images)
**Total:** 84-168 hours over 12 weeks
**Mostly upload, review, approve workflow**

### **Phase 3: Post-Production (Weeks 18-26)**
**Time Required:** 3-4 hours per day, 5-6 days per week
**Total:** 120-192 hours over 8 weeks
**Editing, color grading, VFX, audio mixing**

**TOTAL TIME INVESTMENT:** 364-648 hours over 7 months

**Per Week Average:** 13-23 hours  
**Per Day Average:** 2-3 hours (weekdays), optional weekends

**This is achievable with a full-time job.** Many independent filmmakers work more hours than this.

## 💰 BUDGET - WHAT IT ACTUALLY COSTS

### **Required Subscriptions:**

**Midjourney Standard:** $30/month × 7 months = $210  
**Runway Pro:** $35/month × 5 months = $175  
**Total Subscriptions:** $385

### **Optional Tools:**

**ElevenLabs Creator:** $22/month × 3 months = $66 (AI voices)  
**Epidemic Sound:** $49/month × 2 months = $98 (music library)  
**Total Optional:** $164

### **VFX Budget:**

**After Effects:** $22.99/month × 3 months = $69 (VFX compositing)  
**VFX Assets/Plugins:** $100-200 (as needed)  
**Total VFX:** $169-269

### **TOTAL BUDGET:** $718-818

**For context:** Traditional indie films cost $50,000-500,000+

**Your film:** Less than $1,000. That's remarkable.
