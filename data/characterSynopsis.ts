Character Breakdown:

The Vanguard:
The Man from the Future.
A green metal man, his armor defines him. He is 1.9 meters tall and is 230 pounds of pure muscle. His entire body is covered with green metal plates that interlock. His face is covered by a helmet with a visor. He has a series of tubes that connect into his body. He drinks from a tube and pees out another. His wrists has two barrels attached, so that he may fire bullets out of his “wrist-gun.”
The Vanguard is a soldier from the future. A time destroyed by technology. His armor was made by the Techno-Priests, blessed with the ability to travel time. Now he must go back and ensure that The Vanguard does not like words, he has a job to do. For he will be the one to change the timeline, by killing Director Duncan.
But even so, the Vanguard has some vices. Mostly video games and alcohol. His helmet visor allows him to play when he is not constantly hunting for alcohol.

Director Duncan
A 50-year-old man with too fancy facial hair. He oversees a secret Research and Development Department for the military. He is extremely arrogant, for his discoveries have change the world, just no one knows it. So, he will make sure everyone he meets knows just how important he is. Director Duncan will sacrifice his subordinates to get what he wants. He will lie, cheat, and otherwise overpower those below him. Yet he is just so polite to them. After all, everyone wants to change the world.
His favorite person in the world is his grandmother. He tells all his secrets to her, especially the ones that are classified.

Miss Jamie Jackson
The failed draftee (conscript).
A woman forced into situations beyond her control. She was forced into the military due to the draft. She is a failure, but only because she does not even want to be there. She is an alcoholic by nature, and this causes her to be sloppy. She is not prepared to enter a facility filled with monsters. She is just trying to get through her situation, without dying or ending up in a jail cell.
